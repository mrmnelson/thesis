\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion}

So there you have it.  The only thing left is the appendix in which you may want to include spectra.  The code for how I did it is as follows:

\small\singlespacing
\begin{verbatim}
\chapter{Raspailodane~F Spectra}
\label{app:raspailodaneFSpectra}

\begin{figure}[!hb]
\begin{flushright}
\includegraphics[height=0.75\textheight]
   {spectra/raspailodaneF1H}
\end{flushright}
\centerline{\proton{} NMR spectrum of raspailodane~F
   (\compound{raspailodaneF}) (300~MHz, \ce{CDCl3})}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[p]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]
   {spectra/raspailodaneFCOSY}
\centerline{COSY spectrum of raspailodane~F
   (\compound{raspailodaneF}) (300~MHz, \ce{CDCl3})}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[p]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]
   {spectra/raspailodaneFHSQC}
\centerline{HSQC spectrum of raspailodane~F
   (\compound{raspailodaneF}) (300~MHz, \ce{CDCl3})}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

\normalsize\doublespacing
Hopefully by now most of that speaks for itself.  The flushright environment just right-aligns everything.  Note the [!hb] tag for the first spectrum -- it wouldn't stay on the same page as the title without the exclamation mark!  The others are all set to full-page images.

My last piece of advice -- I read once that \LaTeX{} treats every word/environment as a ``box''.  Words are boxes with stretchy space between them.  A minipage is just a box with more boxes in it.  If you use a command like ``\small\verb$\mbox{...}$\normalsize'' then the text is all contained in the one box which you will need to make sure isn't too big for your line since it no longer contains ``stretchy space''.

Included with this template is a copy of my thesis.  It is an online pdf version of the document so it includes coloured links and back-referencing which I have left out of the basic template.  If you want to know how I did that, or anything in particular which I may not have detailed here, please ask.

Best of luck.
