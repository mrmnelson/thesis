The decreasing availability of readily and cheaply accessible fossil fuels combined with concern about climate change driven by carbon emissions, is prompting a search for alternative chemical feedstocks. Biogas is a carbon neutral source of methane generated from the anaerobic digestion of organic waste. However, methane is a permanent gas and as such is very expensive and difficult to transport from the remote generation sites. Conversion of methane to a readily transportable liquid is challenging due to the high stability of C-H bonds.

Pincer ligands have recently gained attention due to their unique combination of stability and active, making them useful ancillary ligands for C-H activation reactions. This project aims to investigate the use of transition metal coordination complexes of novel POP pincer ligands as potential catalysts for the C-H activation of methane.
