OK, finally to make your document, you're going to need to run the following commands:

\small\singlespacing
\begin{verbatim}
pdflatex thesis
bibtex thesis
pdflatex thesis
bibtex thesis
makeglos.pl thesis
pdflatex thesis
pdflatex thesis
\end{verbatim}

\normalsize\doublespacing
or

\small\singlespacing
\begin{verbatim}
pdflatex thesis
bibtex thesis
pdflatex thesis
bibtex thesis
makeindex -s thesis.ist -t thesis.glg -o thesis.gls thesis.glo
pdflatex thesis
pdflatex thesis
\end{verbatim}

\normalsize\doublespacing

If you are using Kile or MiKTeX, most of this will be done automatically.  However, you should ensure that BibTeX and makeindex processing are enabled for your project.  In MiKTeX, you can set the makeindex parameters to the following to achieve the required results:

-s ``\%bm''.ist -t ``\%bm''.glg -o ``\%bm''.gls ``\%bm''.glo

In Linux, it is easier to use the provided makeglos.pl perl script.

Note that ``pdflatex'' is run several times (perhaps more than is strictly necessary) in order to ensure that all cross-referencing is correct.

If you are using latex instead of pdflatex, simply substitute ``latex'' for ``pdflatex''.
