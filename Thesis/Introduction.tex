\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

It is now widely accepted that climate change is occurring at an unprecedented rate.\cite{Oreskes2004}  The concentration of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere has been increasing since the industrial revolution (Figure~\ref{Greenhousegases})\cite{Jacobs1999}.  In addition, new greenhouse gases such as \glspl{CFC} are also accumulating in the atmosphere.  \cite{Jacobs1999}  Energy from the sun is absorbed by the surface of the earth and then radiated out into the atmosphere at wavelengths between 5 and 50 \SI{}{\micro\metre}.  Much of this energy is absorbed by atmospheric gases such as ozone and water vapour, however there is a small ``atmospheric window'' between 8 and 13 \SI{}{\micro\metre} where energy can escape into the solar system.  Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb energy in this atmospheric window and rather than letting the energy escape into the solar system, it is radiated back towards earth.\cite{Hardy2003}  As such, the increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations lead to increases in global temperature.\cite{Jacobs1999}

Carbon dioxide absorbs strongly above 10 \SI{}{\micro\metre} making it a potent greenhouse gas.\cite{Goody1951}  Prior to the industrial revolution, the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere was balanced by the amount taken up by natural sinks such as the oceans and the biosphere.  However, the burning of fossil fuels has increased the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.  As the carbon in the fossil fuels has been effectively removed from the natural carbon cycle for millennia, the natural sinks for carbon dioxide (biosphere and oceans) have been unable to cope with the increase in concentration resulting in accumulation within the atmosphere.\cite{Jacobs1999}

Fossil fuels are also a prominent source of chemical feedstocks.\cite{Shilov1997}  The alkanes can be converted into alkenes and alkynes \emph{via} hydrothermal cracking and these can be oxidised or otherwise converted to form useful chemical starting materials.  However, the hydrothermal cracking is highly inefficient requiring high temperatures and producing a large range of undesirable by-products.\cite{Shilov1997}  The potential environmental damage from using fossil fuels, together with the mounting costs associated with their extraction, means alternative chemical feedstocks are desirable both environmentally and economically.\cite{Poliakoff2002, Crabtree2011b}

Biogas is a mixture of gases containing primarily methane and carbon dioxide with small amounts of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and other impurities.\cite{Abatzoglou2009}  Generated by the anaerobic digestion of wet organic waste, biogas is considered carbon neutral as the carbon in the organic matter, which is converted to the biogas, is already within the carbon cycle.\cite{Amon2007}  New Zealand has a number of plants to capture the biogas produced from landfill, sewage, farm and food waste.\fixme{cite(Biogas)}  Typically the biogas collected is used for on-site electricity production or co-generation of electricity and methane.

Biogas also has the potential to act as a chemical feedstock for industrial processes that typically use components extracted from crude oil.\cite{Poliakoff2002}  However, there are several issues associated with the use of biogas as a chemical feedstock.  Biogas is often produced at remote sites and as it mostly contains methane, it cannot be transported economically,\cite{Crabtree2001} hence on-site conversion of the methane into a readily transportable liquid such as methanol would reduce the transportation costs considerably.  However methane, like other alkanes, is unreactive towards most chemical transformations.  Although methane can be oxidised, the low reactivity means that severe conditions or highly active reagents are required.  The methanol that is produced is more easily oxidised than methane so over-oxidation to the undesirable carbon dioxide occurs readily. \cite{Crabtree2001}  

One of the most commonly used processes to form methanol from methane is the syngas process.  This first converts the methane to carbon monoxide, then reduces it to methanol.  The formation of synthesis gas (Equation \ref{syngasequation}) is carried out over a heterogeneous nickel catalyst and requires pressures of 40 atm and high temperatures of 850 \degrees C.  This is followed by reaction over a mixture of copper, zinc oxide and alumina at 50 - 100 atm and 250 \degrees C (Equation \ref{syngasequation2}). The process is inefficient as the methane is over-oxidised before being reduced to methanol\cite{Crabtree2001} and although the production of synthesis gas yields three moles of hydrogen, only two of these are used in the production of methanol.  The addition of \ce{CO2} to the system allows for reaction of the excess hydrogen to produce methanol and water (Equation \ref{syngasequation3}).

\section{C-H activation}

Carbon-hydrogen bonds are among the least reactive bonds as evidenced by their presence in all organic molecules.\cite{Shilov1997}  Indeed the old name for alkanes ``paraffins'' is derived from the Latin \emph{parum affinis} meaning without affinity.  Alkanes have also been referred to as the ``noble gases of organic chemistry.''\cite{Shilov1997}  The carbon-hydrogen bond is considered to be a very strong bond with a bond dissociation enthalpy of 438~kJmol$^{-1}$ for methane.\fixme{cite
(SI2002)}  This compares to an average carbon-oxygen bond of 358~kJmol$^{-1}$, and a carbon-carbon single bond of 346~kJmol$^{-1}$.\fixme{cite(SI2002)}  In addition, alkanes have very high ionisation potentials and pK\sub{a} values, and low proton affinities.\cite{Shilov2000}  Alkenes typically have stronger C-H bonds than alkanes, for example ethene and ethyne have bond dissociation enthalpies of 444 and 502 kJmol$^{-1}$ respectively, compared to 410 kJmol$^{-1}$ for ethane.\cite{Shilov1997}  However, the reduced steric hindrance in alkenes leads to greater kinetic reactivity, and stronger aryl-metal bonds result in a thermodynamic driving force for the C-H activation to occur.\cite{Crabtree2001}

%bond lengths 1.08 C-H, 1.43 C-O, 1.54 C-C

%Ethene, ethyne and benzene all have stronger C-H bonds of 444, 502 and 456 .\cite{Shilov1997}  As such, a carbon-hydrogen bond in an alkane is unlikely to react without strong reagents or severe conditions.\cite{Crabtree2001}

C-H activation refers to the increased reactivity of carbon hydrogen bonds that occurs as a result of interaction with another reagent.\cite{Crabtree2001}  Functionalisation involves the replacement of the C-H bond with another functional group (X) to form a C-X bond.  This reaction may occur in a number of different ways depending on the reactivity of the metal complex.\cite{Shilov2000}  Activation is typically easier than functionalisation as the metal alkyl and hydride often recombine \emph{via} reductive elimination during attempts to functionalise.\cite{Crabtree2001}  
%However, the functionalisation is crucial for the conversion of methane to a useful feedstock.

%The functionalisation step may be viewed as a organic reaction occuring on a metal support which is important for the activation of the bond.\fixme{reword this?}  

%This is essentially an organic reaction following activation.\cite{Crabtree2001}  

There are three main processes by which C-H activation can occur.\cite{Shilov2000}  The first is the organometallic activation which involves the formation of a metal-carbon bond.  This may involve cleavage of the bond through either oxidative addition (Equation \ref{Oxidativeequation}) or electrophilic substitution (Equation \ref{Electrophilicequation})  In the second type the alkane C-H bond interacts with a ligand on the metal rather than the metal itself (Equation \ref{Oxidationequation}).  The third type involves the generation of a reactive species by the metal complex, which then attacks the C-H bond (Equation \ref{Radicalequation}).  Systems where organometallic activation occurs will be the focus of this proposal.

\end{align}

%\fixme{similarities between C-H and H-H activation}

Alkanes can react at elevated temperature with oxygen in the atmosphere to form the thermodynamically stable products water and carbon dioxide (Equation \ref{Combustion}).  However, alkanes are inert in air at room temperature in the absence of a catalyst.\cite{Shilov1997}  Alkanes can be converted into other hydrocarbons by heating.  This forms radical species which can combine to form longer or shorter chain alkanes, alkenes and alkynes.\cite{Sironi1990}  For example, methane may be converted into ethane, ethene and ethyne by heating at temperatures in excess of 900 \degrees C.\cite{Shilov1997}  Alkanes can also be protonated by superacids, leading to elimination of hydrogen gas, giving an overall hydride abstraction reaction.  However, the elimination occurs selectively with the most basic hydride and the superacids used will attack a number of functional groups.\cite{Crabtree2004}

%\end{equation}

The presence of other functional groups on the molecule can result in activation of a C-H bond.  A common example of this is protons $\alpha$ to a carbonyl group that are easily removed in the presence of a base.  This forms the basis for a number of widely utilised organic reactions such as the aldol condensation reaction (Scheme~\ref{Aldolcondensation})\cite{Saito2004}.  However in alkanes, no functional groups are present to activate the bond so it is necessary to activate the bond using an external source such as an enzyme or coordination complex.\cite{Crabtree2001}

Complex organic molecules are synthetic targets as a result of their potential use as pharmaceuticals.  Currently the synthesis of these target molecules relies on the modification of existing functional groups.  The regio- and stereo-selective activation and functionalisation of C-H bonds within complex organic molecules would result in a major paradigm shift in organic synthesis.\cite{Davies2008}

\subsection{Biological systems}

As previously discussed, the oxidation of methane to methanol without over-oxidation to carbon dioxide is desirable in order to make use of biogas as a chemical feedstock.\cite{Crabtree2001}  Like many other desirable chemical transformations, enzymes exist that are capable of performing the reaction.  Methane monooxygenase and cytochrome P450 catalyse the oxidation of alkanes to alcohols (Equation \ref{Methanemonooxygenaseequation}).\cite{Crabtree1995}  Although methane monooxygenase is specfic for methane, cytochrome P450 enzymes will catalyse the oxidation of a range of alkanes.\cite{Lipscomb1994, Crabtree2001}

\vspace{-0.8 cm}
\begin{equation}
\ce{NADPH + O2 + RH + H+} \longrightarrow \ce{NADP+ + H2O + ROH}
\label{Methanemonooxygenaseequation}
\end{equation}

Methane monooxygenase is found in bacteria that exist at the interface of aerobic and anaerobic environments found in lakes, oceans and soils.\cite{Lipscomb1994}  These bacteria are described as methanotrophic, they utilise methane as their source of carbon and energy.\cite{Haber1983}  Methane monooxygenase consists of three proteins; component B, reductase and hydroxylase.\cite{Lipscomb1994}  The hydroxylase protein contains a dinuclear iron centre that activates oxygen to form an oxo-bridged system.  This reacts with methane to give methanol and a hydroxo-bridged diiron centre.\cite{Merkx2001}  However, despite numerous studies,\cite{Lipscomb1994, Merkx2001, Tinberg2011} the mechanism of methane monooxygenase has proved elusive with a number of different mechanisms proposed (Scheme \ref{Methanemonooxygenasemechanism}).

%The hydroxylase protein contains a hydroxo-bridged dinuclear iron that forms that active catalytic site.  Both iron atoms are reduced to Fe(II) and then react with \ce{O2} The O-O bond is cleaved to give water and a Fe(IV)Fe(IV)=O species which can abstract a hydrogen from methane.  This gives an OH radical and a \ce{CH3} radical which recombine to form methanol.\fixme{SCHEME}

\end{scheme}

Cytochrome P450 enzymes are found in a most classes of organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants, insects and mammals.\cite{Montellano2010}  The consistent feature across all P450 enzymes is the presence of a heme group with a coordinated thiolate ion at the active site of the molecule.\cite{Montellano2010}  The first step in metabolism of pharmaceuticals in the body, phase 1, typically involves oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis reactions.  P450 enzymes are responsible for the phase 1 metabolism of around 75\% of known pharmaceuticals.\cite{Rittle2010}  Although the enzymes perform a number of roles, one of the most interesting is the hydroxylation of C-H bonds.\cite{Rittle2010}

The overall catalytic cycle for the hydroxylation of an alkane by a P450 enzyme reported by de Montellano\cite{Montellano2010} is given in Scheme \ref{P450catalyticcycle}.  In the resting state (A) the Fe(III) is bound to a thiolate and the \emph{trans} ligand is typically a water molecule though some P450's do not have a \emph{trans} ligand.  The water is displaced upon binding of an RH group.  Binding of the RH allows electron transfer to occur, reducing the Fe(III) to Fe(II) (C).  Oxygen binds to the Fe(II) resulting in the superoxide complex D.  This undergoes electron transfer and protonation to form the hydroperoxo complex E.  This complex is protonated and undergoes loss of \ce{H2O} to form the porphyrin radical cation F.  F can then react with the substrate to give the alcohol product.  Following product release and rebinding of water the resting state is restored.

\subsection{Organometallic systems}

There are a number of different types of bonds that can form in organometallic systems (Figure \ref{Bondingmodes}).  The most common is the donation of a ligand lone pair of electrons to a vacant orbital on the metal (a).  This is typically observed for ligands such as \ce{PR3,~CH3^-~and~H2O} among many others.  Donation of a $\pi$-bonding pair of electrons to the metal (b) is also common, typically among the alkene complexes such as those with ethene.  There are a number of rarer bonding forms including the donation of a $\sigma$-bonding pair of electrons (c) and the alkyl agostic interaction (d).\cite{Bernskoetter2009}  In addition, the metal can donate electron density from filled d orbitals into the LUMO of the ligand (either the $\sigma$* or $\pi$* orbital).\cite{Chatt1955}

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption[Bonding in organometallic complexes]{Bonding in organometallic complexes}
\label{Bondingmodes}
\end{figure}

Alkanes are weak $\sigma$-bases and $\pi$-acids.  As such they are very poor ligands for transition metals.\cite{Crabtree1993}  Typically alkanes form $\sigma$-complexes with metals that can $\pi$-backbond.  For successful complexation a low valent metal and the absence of competitive decomposition pathways are required.\cite{Crabtree2001}  Enhanced bonding of alkanes occurs with metals capable of forming enhanced $\pi$-backbonding into the $\sigma$* C-H orbital, similar to that found for molecular hydrogen complexes.\cite{Kubas1988}

The activation of C-H bonds is thought occur \emph{via} a stepwise process involving the coordination of the alkane to the metal to form a $\sigma$-complex, followed by the oxidative cleavage of the C-H bond forming metal-alkyl and metal-hydride bonds.\cite{Labinger2002}  The intermediate  $\sigma$-complexes are highly unstable and until recently their existence had only been inferred by isotope scrambling and the inverse kinetic isotope effect in reductive elimination reactions of alkyl hydrides.\cite{Bernskoetter2009, Labinger2002}  In 2009 Brookhart reported the characterisation of a relatively long-lived rhodium(I) $\sigma$-methane complex.\cite{Bernskoetter2009}  The complex was formed by the protonation of a rhodium methyl complex (Scheme \ref{Sigmamethane}).  At -87~\degrees C the methane is displaced by solvent (\ce{CDCl2F}) with a half-life of 83 minutes.

%$\sigma$-Complexes of methane have been proposed 
%The first example of C-H activation was reported by Dimroth in 1902\cite{Dimroth1902}  Reaction of phenol with a solution of mercury acetate on a steam bath replaced the \emph{ortho} and \emph{para}-protons with a mercury acetate group.  \fixme{more info etc}

C-H activation has developed significantly since the first example of C-H activation by an organometallic complex was reported by Chatt in 1962. \cite{Chatt1962}  Reduction of metal halides by sodium napthalene in the presence of an excess of \gls{dmpe} produced V, Cr, Mo and W complexes of the form \ce{[M(}\gls{dmpe}\ce{)_3]},  and Fe and Co complexes of the form \ce{[M(}\gls{dmpe}\ce{)_2]}.  However, the \ce{[Ru(}\gls{dmpe}\ce{)_2]} analogue gave a hydride complex ``by taking hydrogen from the napthalene.''\cite{Chatt1962}  

Further analysis of the ruthenium system was carried out and published in 1965.\cite{Chatt1965} Reaction of \emph{cis}- or \emph{trans}-\ce{[RuCl2(}\gls{dmpe}\ce{)_2]} with benzene, naphthalene, anthracene and phenylanthracene formed the \emph{cis}-\ce{[RuH(aryl)(}\gls{dmpe}\ce{)_2]} (aryl = phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl and phenanthryl) complexes \emph{via} oxidative addition.\cite{Chatt1965}  The activation is reversible, as reactions of the complexes with hydrochloric acid yielded hydrogen gas, the aromatic starting material and \emph{cis}-\ce{[RuCl2(}\gls{dmpe}\ce{)_2]} (Equation \ref{ChattCH}).  The C-H activation to form the complexes was selective for example, in the reaction with naphthalene the activation occurred exclusively at the 2-position.

\vspace{-0.6 cm}
\begin{equation}
\ce{[RuH(C10H7)(dmpe)2] + 2HCl} \longrightarrow \ce{[RuCl2(dmpe)2] + H2 + C10H8}
\label{ChattCH}
\end{equation}

The naphthyl hydride complex formed by treatment of \ce{[Ru(}\gls{dmpe}\ce{)_2]} with naphthalene thermally decomposed giving a complex with properties consistent with \ce{[Ru(}\gls{dmpe}\ce{)_2]} (Scheme \ref{Chattdmpescheme}).\cite{Chatt1965}  However, infrared spectroscopy showed a signal for a Ru-H at 1791 \percm,  leading to the proposed structure of \ce{[RuH(CH2PMeCH2CH2PMe2)(}\gls{dmpe})], formed by activation of a C-H bond from the \gls{dmpe} ligand.\cite{Chatt1965}  X-ray crystallography later allowed the reformulation of the structure to the analogous dimer.\cite{Crabtree2004}  However, this species remains the first example of cyclometallation of an sp$^3$ C-H bond.

The exchange of hydrogen with deuterium in polyalkyl benzenes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocycles can be catalysed by homogeneous platinum (II) species.\cite{Hodges1968, Hodges1969, Hodges1969b}  Using deutero-acetic acid as a solution in \ce{D2O}, together with DCl or anhydrous tin(IV) chloride to prevent the formation of platinum metal, H/D exchange on the substrate was observed when exposed to \ce{Na2PtCl4} or \ce{K2PtCl4}.\cite{Hodges1968, Hodges1969}  Although the rate of exchange was faster for unhindered aromatic protons, H/D exchange was also observed for alkyl protons.\cite{Hodges1969b}  The rate was fastest for \hbox{\emph{p}-xylene}, \gls{mesitylene}, \emph{m}-xylene and toluene, however exchange of alkyl protons was also observed in \emph{o}-xylene, \gls{hemimellitene} and \gls{durene}.\cite{Hodges1969b}

This activation of alkyl protons inspired Shilov to investigate the C-H activation of alkanes by platinum.  The system carries out oxidation of alkanes such as methane \emph{via} electrophilic activation (Scheme \ref{Shilovcatalyticcycle}).\cite{Labinger2002, Crabtree2001}  The first step involves displacement of a chloride ligand on the platinum by a $\sigma$-methyl followed by oxidative addition and loss  of H$^+$ \emph{via} loss of HCl.  The Pt(II) is then  oxidised to Pt(IV) \emph{via} electron transfer to the \ce{PtCl6}$^{2-}$.  Finally, the complexed methyl undergoes nucleophilic attack from water displacing the \emph{trans} chloride ion to form HCl, methanol and regenerate the catalyst.  The system has shown selectivity for terminal C-H bonds.  For example, in the oxidation of ethanol functionalisation occurs at the methyl to yield ethylene glycol (Equation \ref{Ethyleneglycol}) whilst, all other methods of oxidation will oxidise the hydroxyl functionality.\cite{Labinger1993}  This can be utilised for the one-pot synthesis of ethylene glycol from ethanol.\cite{Sen1994}  However, the selectivity is lost in reaction with 2-propanol which gives only acetone.\cite{Labinger1993}

\label{Ethyleneglycol}
\end{equation}

Although the Shilov system is catalytic in Pt(II), it requires a stoichiometric amount of Pt(IV).  In addition, the Pt(II) catalyst is unstable in solution and eventually precipitates as platinum metal.\cite{Luinstra1995}  This results in an expensive and thus impractical system for industrial application.  The relatively low yields of the system also reduce its industrial viability.\cite{Periana1993}  Furthermore, the reaction produces two equivalents of hydrochloric acid which require disposal at significant cost.\cite{Poliakoff2001}  A number of attempts have been made to replace the Pt(IV) primary oxidant thus making an economically viable system.\cite{Periana1993, Periana1998, Hashiguchi2010}  However, this has proven challenging as most oxidants tend to convert Pt(II) to the inactive Pt(IV).\cite{Crabtree2001}  Additionally, an oxidant is required that will not attack the product alcohol.  

In 1993 Periana reported the use of concentrated sulfuric acid as the primary oxidant and Hg(II) as a catalyst in place of the platinum.\cite{Periana1993}  The Hg(II) is the highest possible oxidation state so further unwanted oxidation of the catalyst is not possible.  Using methane as the feedstock, the system produces methyl bisulfate in a 43\% yield (Scheme \ref{Mercurycatalyticcycle}).  This has the advantage of being highly resistant to oxidation preventing the formation of carbon dioxide. However, the catalysis involves the formation of MeHg(II)$^+$ as an intermediate following activation.  Methyl mercury salts, like most organomercury compounds, are extremely toxic and exhibit accumulation effects in biological systems.\fixme{cite(MethylmercuryMSDS)}  Sulfur dioxide, a significant contributor to acid rain,\cite{Jacobs1999} is also produced as a stoichiometric byproduct of this reaction.  However, the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid by air is an established industrial process and could be utilised to provide further sulfuric acid for the process.\cite{Periana1993}

Further work by Periana investigated changing the Pt(II) system to improve stability, activity and prevent oxidation to Pt(IV).\cite{Periana1998}  Nitrogen donor ligands were utilised as oxygen systems have high kinetic lability on platinum and phosphorus ligands have poor oxidative and thermal stability.  The use of \emph{cis}- or \emph{trans}-\ce{[PtCl2(NH3)2]} in concentrated sulfuric acid at 180~\degrees C gave 90\% selectivity for methyl bisulfate.  However, the catalyst degraded to insoluble \ce{PtCl2} and \ce{NH4HSO4}.  

In an extension of this work a $\pi$-acidic chelating donor ligand \gls{bpym} was utilised as $\pi$-donor ligands were expected to have lower proton affinity and form stronger Pt-N bonds than the \ce{NH3} ligands used previously.  The \ce{[PtCl2(}\gls{bpym})] complex was tested in 20 \% \ce{SO3} in \ce{H2SO4} at 200~\degrees C for 50 hours.  Some free ligand and HCl was observed, however the solution remained homogenous showing no formation of platinum metal or other insoluble products.  Using \emph{cis}-\ce{[PtCl2(}\gls{bpym})] in the catalytic system at 220~\degrees C for 2.5 hours resulted in 90\% methane conversion with an 81\% selectivity (carbon dioxide forming the major byproduct).\cite{Periana1998}  However, this reaction requires high temperatures and forms significant amounts of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide both of which are environmentally hazardous.\cite{Jacobs1999}  The reaction proceeds \emph{via} a slightly different mechanism to the mercury system (Scheme \ref{PerianaPtcycle}) with oxidation occurring prior to the functionalisation.\cite{Periana1998}

\subsection{Alkane dehydrogenation}

Alkane dehydrogenation is an alternative approach that combines the activation and functionalisation into a single step.  This methodology was developed from the \hbox{organometallic} complexes such as Wilkinson's\cite{Osborn1966} and Crabtree's\cite{Crabtree1979b} catalysts (Figure \ref{Wilkinsoncrabtree}) that are utilised as homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts.  Wilkinson's catalyst was the first homogeneous hydrogenation catalyst with comparable rates to the heterogeneous counterparts and has become very widely utilised in organic synthesis.\cite{Knowles2003}

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[]{../Figures/Wilkinsoncrabtree.pdf}
\caption[Wilkinson's and Crabtree's catalysts]{Wilkinson's (a) and Crabtree's (b) catalysts}
\label{Wilkinsoncrabtree}
\end{figure}

Crabtree reported a number of hydrogenation catalysts based on Wilkinson's catalyst in 1977.\cite{Crabtree1977} The most active of these, \ce{[Ir(cod)(PCy3)(py)]PF6} (Figure \ref{Wilkinsoncrabtree} b, \gls{cod} = 1,5-cyclooctadiene, \gls{Cy}~=~cyclohexyl, \gls{py} = pyridyl) has become known as Crabtree's catalyst.\cite{Cui2005}  This catalyst is active for the hydrogenation of a range of \hbox{mono-,} di-, \hbox{tri-,} and \hbox{tetra-substituted} alkenes with turnover frequencies (\glspl{TOF}) of 6400, 4500, 3800 and 4000 for hex-1-ene, cyclohexene, 1-methylcyclohexene and 2,3-dimethylbut-2-ene respectively.\cite{Crabtree1979b}  Crabtree's catalyst is useful for the hydrogenation of tri- and tetra-substituted alkenes for which Wilkinson's catalyst is inactive.\cite{Cui2005}

A catalytic system lowers the activation energy for a reaction, hence both the forward and reverse reactions will be catalysed.\cite{Crabtree2001}  This realisation led Crabtree to test an iridium system for dehydrogenation of alkenes.\cite{Crabtree1979}  The dehydrogenation would normally be strongly endothermic so the substrates were chosen to give products that would bind strongly to the metal to improve the thermodynamics of the reaction.  In the presence of \ce{[IrH2(alkene)2(PPh3)2]+} and 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene (as hydrogen acceptor) the dehydrogenation of cyclooctene, [2.2.2]bicyclooctene, cyclopentene and cyclohexene were carried out successfully to give complexes of the type \ce{[Ir(diene)(PPh3)2]+} and \ce{[Ir(Cp)H(PPh3)]+} (Cp = cyclopentadienyl).\cite{Crabtree1979}  The dehydrogenation of alkanes was also possible with the system.  The dehydrogenation of cyclopentane to form the cyclopentadienyl complex gave a 30\% yield after 18 hours, whilst the dehydrogenation of cyclooctane to the cyclooctadiene complex gave a 70\% yield after only 4 hours.\cite{Crabtree1979}

Felkin reported a rhenium complex capable of dehydrogenating linear alkanes to dienes.\cite{Baudry1982}  In the presence of \ce{[ReH7(PAr3)2]} (Ar = \emph{p}-\ce{MeC6H4}) and 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene, \emph{n}-pentane was dehydrogenated to form a diene complex (Scheme \ref{Pentanedehydrogenation}).  Treatment of this complex with \ce{P(OMe)3} produced pent-1-ene with a yield of 45\%.  This was extended to the linear isomers of hexane, heptane and octane.\cite{Baudry1984}  Although pentane can form only one conjugated diene complex, hexane and heptane can give two, whilst octane can give three.  However, in all cases upon treatment of the complex with \ce{P(OMe)3} the terminal alkene was formed with a selectivity of over 95\%.\cite{Baudry1984}

\end{scheme}

Wilkinson's catalyst (figure \ref{Wilkinsoncrabtree}b) has also been utilised as a dehydrogenation catalyst.\cite{Fujii1990}  The dehydrogenation of cyclooctane to give cyclooctene by \ce{[RhCl(L)3]} (L = \ce{PPh3} or P(\emph{p}-\ce{tolyl)3}) was carried out at reflux (151~\degrees C) without the need for a hydrogen acceptor.  The high temperature of the reaction mixture is sufficient to allow the removal of molecular hydrogen from the reaction mixture.\cite{Fujii1990}  The reaction rates obtained with this system were low, the highest with L = P(\emph{p}-\ce{tolyl)3} was only 1.24 h\ce{^{-1}} with a L/Rh ratio of 8.\cite{Fujii1990}

Crabtree utilised this acceptorless methodology to test the catalytic activity of iridium complexes.\cite{Aoki1993}  \ce{[IrH2L(PCy3)2]} (L = \ce{O2CCF3}, \ce{O2CC2F5} and \ce{O2CPhCH2}) were active for the dehydrogenation of cyclooctane under reflux with initial turnover frequencies of 1.41, 1.05 and 0.22 \ce{h^{-1}} respectively.  However, the complexes were unstable with deactivation half lives of 15, 34 and 14 hours respectively.\cite{Aoki1993}  Alternate methods to remove the hydrogen were also tested.  Using perfluorodecalin as a solvent allowed for more effective hydrogen removal due to the higher volatility compared to cyclooctane.  This resulted in poor activity with a turnover frequency of 0.24 \ce{h^{-1}} using \ce{[IrH2(O2CCF3)(PCy3)2]} as catalyst.  Bubbling inert gas was unsuccessful with cyclooctane as a substrate as a large amount of the substrate was lost.  However, using the less volatile cyclodecane a turnover frequency of 0.48 \ce{h^{-1}}  was obtained.\cite{Aoki1993}

\section{Pincer ligands}

Recently, the so-called pincer ligands have attracted a great deal of research attention due to their unique balance of stability and reactivity.\cite{Becerra2009}  Pincer ligands are tridentate ligands that bind in a meridional fashion, examples of which are given in Figure \ref{Pincernaming}.  Pincer ligands are named based on their donor atoms such as, PCP, NCN, and POP.  If the groups between the donor atoms contain heteroatoms then these may be included in the naming also, for example POCOP.  The pincer ligands may be anionic (as with PCP ligands) or neutral (PNP and POP).\cite{Vlugt2009, Kataoka1995}  Although phosphines are the most common donor groups, amines,\cite{Singleton2003} imines,\cite{Takenaka2005} thioethers\cite{Zim2000} and N-heterocyclic carbenes\cite{Hahn2007} have all been reported.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[]{../Figures/Pincernaming.pdf}
\caption[Naming of pincer ligands]{Naming of pincer ligands}
\label{Pincernaming}
\end{figure}

The first reports of pincer ligands were in 1976 by Shaw\cite{Moulton1976} and Alcock.\cite{Alcock1976}  Shaw reported a \emph{tert}-butyl PCP ligand (Figure \ref{Shaw}) and introduced the naming scheme that has become commonplace for pincer ligands.  When reacted with an appropriate metal precursor, complexes formed between the tridentate ligand with nickel, palladium, platinum, rhodium and iridium with chloride, nitrile, hydride and carbon monoxide ligands.\cite{Moulton1976} 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[]{../Figures/Shaw.pdf}
\caption[First reported PCP pincer ligand]{First reported PCP pincer ligand}

\end{figure}

Alcock reported X-ray crystal structures of the first complexes of POP ligands (Figure \ref{Alcock}).\cite{Alcock1976}  These formed rhodium carbonyl complexes that were characterised by X-ray crystallography.  With a single ether group in the backbone it forms a typical pincer complex, bonding through the phosphorus and oxygen atoms.  However, when there are three ether units the phosphorus atoms bond to the rhodium but the oxygen H-bonds to a water molecule that is bound to the rhodium centre.\cite{Alcock1976}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[]{../Figures/Alcock.pdf}
\caption[First reported POP pincer ligand]{First reported POP pincer ligand}
\label{Alcock}
\end{figure}

%Typically the central donor atom E is a carbon from an aromatic ring that binds through C-H activation to form a metallacycle.\cite{Choi2011}  

The different components of pincer ligands have significant influence on the steric and electronic properties and hence their reactivity.\cite{Singleton2003}  Altering the group X (Figure \ref{Pincerligands}) can lead to significant electronic effects mostly through the \emph{trans} influence.\cite{Choi2011}  For example, a carbon donor ligand has a greater \emph{trans} influence than an oxygen donor, so ligands \emph{trans} to X in PXP complexes will be bound more strongly when X~=~O than X~=~C.\cite{Zhu2008} The donor group Y controls the steric environment around the metal centre and the electron density.\cite{Choi2011}  Changing the backbone and other remote groups gives control over the electron density on the metal and can be used to improve solubility properties.\cite{Choi2011}

\includegraphics[]{../Figures/Pincerligands.pdf}
\caption[General representation of pincer ligands]{General representation of pincer ligands}
\label{Pincerligands}
\end{figure}

The tridentate coordination of pincer ligands, typically forming two five-membered metallacycles, imparts significant stability to metal complexes with pincer ligands.\cite{Choi2011}  The stability of the complexes is such that the backbone can undergo functionalisation at the 4-position to trimethylsilane \emph{via} lithiation with \emph{tert}-butyllithium and treatment with trimethylchlorosilane without inducing any decomposition of the platinum complex (Scheme \ref{Stability}).\cite{Albrecht2001}  This inherent stability allows the complexes to act as catalysts for highly endothermic reactions that require high temperatures, such as alkane dehydrogenation.\cite{Choi2011}

Coordination complexes of pincer ligands have a large number of applications.  Platinum complexes of an NCN pincer ligand have been utilised as sensors for the detection of sulfur dioxide.\cite{Albrecht2000, Albrecht2000c, Albrecht2001}  Palladium and nickel complexes of a number of pincer ligands have shown activity in cross-coupling reactions.\cite{Hahn2007, Bedford2000, Kimura2006, Zim2000, Obora2006} Theoretical studies have shown potential uses for pincer ligands in water-splitting\cite{Sandhya2011} and nitrogen fixation.\cite{Holscher2007}  However, one of the most prominent uses of pincer ligands is the activation of C-H bonds, typically as dehydrogenation catalysts.\cite{Choi2011, Albrecht2001, Crabtree2001}

%\subsection{Gas sensors}

%Platinum complexes of an NCN pincer (Figure \ref{Gassensors} \fixme{reference the structure correctly}) have been studied in solution or the crystalline state for use in the detection of sulfur dioxide.\cite{Albrecht2000, Albrecht2000c, Albrecht2001b}  In the presence of sulfur dioxide the square planar complex rapidly (less than 50 \si{\micro\second} adsorb the gas to form square pyramidal structures.\cite{Albrecht2000}  The adsorption is accompanied by a dramatic colour change from colourless to bright orange and is reversible upon exposure to a sulfur dioxide free atmosphere.\cite{Albrecht2000}  Dendrimer derivatives (2 and 3, Figure \ref{Gassensors}) can be used to detect sulfur dioxide at concentrations as low as 5 ppm (in a nitrogen atmosphere) \cite{Albrecht2001b}

%These sensors have been studied further for physiological applications.  The complex (Figure \ref{Physiologicalgassensors}) is stable in both acidic and basic aqueous solutions for prolonged periods.\cite{Albrecht2000b}  Testing in conditions known to lead to rapid protein degradation (pH < 1, 50 \degrees C, 5 hours) results in no detectable decomposition.\cite{Albrecht2000b}  The coordination of sulfur dioxide to the complex results in a large shift in the $^{195}$Pt NMR of 1150 ppm (from -3150 to -2000 ppm).\cite{Albrecht2000b}  This could be detected by MRI for medical applications.  These complexes are also being developed for use as molecular switches for opto-electronics.\cite{Albrecht2000c}

%\subsection{Cross-coupling reactions}

%Coordination complexes of pincer ligands also find use as catalysts in carbon-carbon cross-coupling reactions such as the Suzuki, Heck \fixme{etc}.

%Pincer ligands with N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) donors are becoming more common.\fixme{reference}  The palladium complexes found in figure \ref{CCCPincers} are active for the heck cross-coupling reaction of aryl bromides with styrene and the suzuki cross-coupling of aryl bromides with phenylboronic acid.\cite{Hahn2007}  Using a 1 mol \% catalyst loading the reaction of 4-bromobenzaldehyde and 4-bromoacetophenone with styrene quantitative yields were obtained after 24 hours regardless of the substituent on the ligand.  Using the \emph{n}-butyl derivatised ligand after two hours yields of 84.1, and 60.0 \% were obtained for reaction of styrene with 4-bromobenzaldehyde and 4-bromoacetophenone respectively.   The \emph{n}-butyl derived ligand formed an active palladium catalyst for the Suzuki cross-coupling of phenylboronic acid with 4-bromobenzaldehyde and 4-bromoacetophenone.  Using a 0.1 \% catalyst loading  yields of 50.7 and 48.7 \% respectively were obtained after two hours and quantitative conversion obtained in 24 hours.

%The palladium complexes with ferrocene based PCP ligands (figure \ref{Ferrocenepalladium}) have been tested for activity in the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction.\cite{Sheloumov2008}  After 4.5 hours the reaction of 4-bromoacetophenone with phenylboronic acid in the presence of 1 and 3 was almost complete with 84 and 84.5 \% yields respectively under homogeneous conditions and quantitative yields under biphasic conditions (decane/\ce{H2O}).  The reaction was much slower with complex 2 with only 66 \% obtained after 15 hours.  Similar activities for all complexes were obtained for the homogeneous reaction of phenylboronic acid with 4-bromoanisole with yields of 77, 79 and 98 \% after 12, 15 and 15.5 hours for 1, 2 and 3 respectively.  However under biphasic conditions complex 2 was much less reactive obtaining a yield of 9 \% after 15 hours compared to 62 and 63.5 \% for 1 and 3 respectively.  The lower activity for complex 2 is thought to be due to the steric bulk of the \emph{tert}-butyl groups though in complex 3 the steric effect is overcome by the electronic influence of the Fe(III) rather than Fe(II).\cite{Sheloumov2008}

%\subsection{Alkane dehydrogenation}

The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes has the potential to develop into an important industrial process allowing alkanes to be used as a chemical feedstock, without requiring high temperature cracking or other inefficient processes.\cite{Choi2011}  The first use of pincer complexes for alkane dehydrogenation was reported by Gupta in 1996.\cite{Gupta1996}  The rhodium and iridium dihydride complexes in figure \ref{Dehydrogenationligands} were tested for the dehydrogenation of cyclooctane in the presence of 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene as hydrogen acceptor.  Rates of 0.8 turnovers h$^{-1}$ at 150~\degrees C were obtained for the rhodium complex, whilst the iridium complex was more active with rates of 82 turnovers h$^{-1}$.\cite{Gupta1996}  The catalysts used were highly stable at this temperature for extended periods and the addition of mercury did not inhibit the reaction indicating a homogeneous system.\cite{Gupta1996}  The higher activity of the iridium complex combined with the high thermal stability has led to a focus on iridium complexes for alkane dehydrogenation.\cite{Choi2011}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[]{../Figures/Dehydrogenationligands.pdf}
\caption[Rhodium and iridium pincer complexes used for alkane dehydrogenation]{Rhodium and iridium pincer complexes used for alkane dehydrogenation}
\label{Dehydrogenationligands}
\end{figure}

The iridium complex (Figure \ref{Dehydrogenationligands}) was also active for the dehydrogenation of cyclic alkanes, tetrahydrofuran and ethylbenzene to give arenes, furan and styrene respectively.\cite{Gupta1997, Gupta1997b}  In all cases the presence of excess 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene as hydrogen acceptor inhibited the reaction so it was necessary to add this periodically.  A nitrogen atmosphere also inhibited reaction indicating competitive binding of nitrogen and alkane to the active site.\cite{Gupta1996, Gupta1997, Gupta1997b}  The iridium complex is also active for the dehydrogenation of cyclooctane and cyclodecane under acceptorless conditions.\cite{Xu1997}  A solution of fresh catalyst could be poisoned by addition of 10\% alkene rendering the catalyst inactive and indicating that the reduction of activity over time is not due to catalyst decomposition.\cite{Xu1997}

A mechanism for the alkane transfer dehydrogenation (Scheme \ref{Dehydrogenationcatalyticcycle}) has been elucidated \emph{via} a kinetics study by Goldman.\cite{Renkema2003}  The 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene inserts into an iridium hydride bond, which is followed by reductive elimination to give the alkane.  The substrate undergoes oxidative addition to the iridium centre, which is followed by $\beta$-hydride elimination to give the alkene product and regenerate the iridium-dihydride.  With a limited concentration of 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene (as is typical for these reactions) the rate determining step is the hydrogenation of the acceptor rather than C-H activation of the alkane, however with an excess of acceptor the rate determing step is the reaction with the cyclooctane.\cite{Renkema2003}  

\begin{scheme}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[]{../Schemes/Dehydrogenationcatalyticcycle.pdf}
\caption[Proposed mechanism for transfer dehydrogenation]{Proposed mechanism for transfer dehydrogenation}
\label{Dehydrogenationcatalyticcycle}
\end{scheme}

The three-coordinate [Ir(PCP)] intermediate formed following C-H elimination (Figure \ref{Dehydrogenationcatalyticcycle}) was proposed on the basis of an NMR study showing that the dihydride complex will react with 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene to give the \emph{trans}-2-(\emph{tert}-butyl)vinyl complex that is in equilibrium with [Ir(PCP)] on an NMR timescale.\cite{Kanzelberger2000}  A more recent study has reported this resting state of the complex as the $\pi$-alkene complex and it is likely that both occur depending on the concentration of the hydrogen acceptor.\cite{Choi2011}  Studies into the acceptorless reaction have shown a similar mechanism.\cite{Krogh2002, Krogh2002b}  In this case the rate determining step is the thermolytic loss of \ce{H2} to give the active dehydrogenation complex [Ir(PCP)].  The inhibition of activity resulting from a build-up of alkene is likely due to the formation of the $\pi$-alkene complex and increased rate of the reverse reaction.\cite{Krogh2002, Krogh2002b}

Introduction of electron-donating groups such as \ce{OCH3} in the \emph{para}-position (Figure \ref{DFTpincers}) was shown to favour oxidative addition of an alkane to the 14-electron [Ir(PCP)] complex whilst disfavouring further addition of alkane to the \ce{[(PCP)Ir(R)(H)]} complex.\cite{Krogh2002c}  In the acceptorless dehydrogenation of cyclodecane at reflux (201 \degrees C) the electron-donating \ce{OCH3} pincer complex achieved 820 turnovers in 48 hours compared to 360 with a hydrogen in the \emph{para}-position.\cite{Zhu2004}   However, in dehydrogenation of \emph{n}-undecane at 196 \degrees C little difference was seen between the H and \ce{OCH3} substituted ligands with turnovers of 76 and 91 respectively after 4 hours.  The less sterically bulky isopropyl derivative (with \ce{OCH3} in the \emph{para}-position) was also tested and achieved 2970 turnovers over 48 hours for the dehydrogenation of cyclodecane, indicating that the steric bulk of the ligand has a significant influence of the rate of reaction.\cite{Zhu2004}   In the dehydrogenation of \emph{n}-undecane at 196~\degrees C the isopropyl catalyst was much less active than the \emph{tert}-butyl with only 30 turnovers achieved after 4 hours.

\caption[Electron-donating pincer ligands]{Electron-donating pincer ligands}

\end{figure}

The steric environment imposed by the pincer ligand has a significant impact on the activity towards alkane dehydrogenation.\cite{Choi2011}  A computational and experimental study into this effect was reported by Brookhart in 2009.\cite{Kundu2009}  By exchanging the \emph{tert}-butyl groups on the xylene based PCP complex for methyl groups the impact of the sterically bulky \emph{tert}-butyl groups on alkane dehydrogenation could be studied.  Exchanging a single \emph{tert}-butyl results in a decrease in the transition state for the rate determining step ($\beta$-H elimination) of 42 kJmol$^{-1}$.  This was offset slightly by an increase of 17 kJmol$^{-1}$ in the bond strength of but-1-ene to the iridium centre.  Exchanging a second \emph{tert}-butyl for a methyl was calculated to have a much smaller overall impact as the but-1-ene bonds much more strongly to the metal centre.\cite{Kundu2009}  These results were supported experimentally in the transfer dehydrogenation of \emph{n}-octane using 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene as the acceptor.  With one and two methyls replacing \emph{tert}-butyl groups, 195 and 140 turnovers were obtained respectively, compared to only 53 for the unmodified ligand.\cite{Kundu2009}

Although the PCP iridium complexes are stable at 150 \degrees C for extended periods, significant decomposition becomes apparent after 24 hours at 200 \degrees C.\cite{Gupta1996}  Ligands based on an anthracene backbone (Figure \ref{Anthraphos}) were developed to achieve a higher level of thermal stability.\cite{Haenel2001}  The ``anthraphos'' ligand forms thermally stable complexes with decomposition occurring at 308 \degrees C for the iridium dihydride complex.  However, in the catalytic dehydrogenation of cyclodecane at 150 \degrees C the complex was less active than the xylene-based systems.  It was proposed that the lack of flexibility in the backbone of anthraphos was responsible for the decreased activity.\cite{Haenel2001}

The bis-phosphinite (POCOP) pincer ligands in Figure \ref{Phosphinite} were reported independently by Brookhart (R = \ce{^{t}Bu}, X = \ce{OCH3}, \ce{CH3}, H, F, \ce{C6F5}, ArF)\cite{Gottker2004, Gottker2004b} and Jensen (R~=~\ce{^{i}Pr}, X = H) in 2004.\cite{Morales2004}  Brookhart's complexes were tested for activity in the transfer dehydrogenation of cyclooctane at 200 \degrees C using 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene as hydrogen acceptor.  These complexes displayed high turnover numbers of up to 2041 after 40 hours forming both cyclooctene and 1,3-cyclooctadiene.\cite{Gottker2004}  The cyclooctadiene product spontaneously converts (most likely \emph{via} a disrotatory ring closure of cyclooctatriene) into \emph{o}-xylene and ethylbenzene (Scheme \ref{Benzeneformation}).\cite{Gottker2004}

The electronic influence of the pincer ligand can also have a dramatic impact on the catalytic activity.  A ruthenium PCP complex with electron-withdrawing \ce{CF3} substituents on the phosphorus atoms (Figure \ref{ElectronwithdrawingPCP}) was tested for transfer and acceptorless dehydrogenation of cyclooctane.\cite{Gruver2011}  The catalyst achieved 186 turnovers at 200 \degrees C after only 30 minutes of transfer dehydrogenation and 10 turnovers in 60 minutes under acceptorless conditions.  This complex was prone to decomposition due to the high temperatures used.  However, the presence of oxygen, nitrogen and water resulted in no significant change to the catalysis which is a significant advantage over other systems.

Pincer complexes based on metallocenes have also been synthesised and tested for use in alkane dehydrogenation (Figure \ref{Metallocenepincers}).\cite{Kuklin2006}  These complexes have much higher activity than those previously reported.  Turnover numbers of 3300 and 2571 were obtained after eight hours for the iron and ruthenium metallocenes, respectively in the transfer dehydrogenation of cyclooctane with 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene as hydrogen acceptor at 180 \degrees C.  This compares with 1843 for the iridium POCOP pincer complex (Figure \ref{Phosphinite}) when tested in the same conditions.  The increased activity was proposed as being due to less steric hindrance of the metal centre compared to the POCOP complex.\cite{Kuklin2006}

\subsection{Alkane metathesis}

Alkene metathesis is a well-known chemical transformation where the groups of two alkenes are exchanged in the presence of an appropriate catalyst.\cite{Astruc2005}  Alkane metathesis follows the same general principle; the exchange of alkane fragments to produce an array of longer and shorter alkanes.\cite{Choi2011}  Although this was first studied from a heterogeneous perspective,\cite{Burnett1973, Vidal1997, Basset2005} more recently homogeneous pincer complexes have been utilised.\cite{Goldman2006}

%Shell higher olefins process

The first alkane metathesis catalysts were heterogeneous mixtures of dehydrogenation/ hydrogenation and metathesis catalysts.\cite{Burnett1973, Vidal1997}   A mixture of tungsten oxide on silica and platinum metal on alumina formed an active alkane metathesis catalyst.\cite{Burnett1973}  The platinum metal dehydrogenates the alkane, which then reacts in an alkene metathesis reaction, followed by hydrogenation by the platinum to form shorter and longer alkanes.  When exposed to \emph{n}-butane a mixture of 24.7, 37.6, 15.9 and 8.6\% of \ce{C3}, \ce{C4}, \ce{C5} and \ce{C6} linear alkanes was obtained with small amounts of branched and higher alkanes.  However, this system required high temperature (400 \degrees C) and was very sensitive to poisoning by water, ammonia, oxygen and hydrogen sulfide.\cite{Burnett1973}

A tantalum hydride catalyst on silica was more successful with catalysis occuring at room temperature.\cite{Vidal1997}  This system followed a slightly different mechanism, shown in Scheme \ref{Tantalumcatalyticcycle}.  The first step involves coordination to the tantalum \emph{via} loss of hydrogen gas.  This is followed by addition of further alkane to form a metallacycle intermediate that rearranges to give the longer chain product and a tantalum methyl species.  This can react with further alkane to form methane and regenerate the catalytic tantalum alkyl species.  This system is active towards a number of alkanes giving a statistical distribution of longer and shorter alkanes, however the turnover numbers obtained were low; 46, 47, 66, 17 and 12 for ethane, propane, butane, isobutane and pentane respectively.\cite{Vidal1997}

\end{scheme}

The use of pincer complexes for alkane metathesis has typically followed the tandem alkane dehydrogenation and alkene metathesis protocol (Scheme \ref{Tandemmetathesis}).\cite{Choi2011} Combining an iridium pincer dehydrogenation catalyst with the Schrock alkene metathesis catalyst (Figure \ref{PCPSchrock}) gave active catalysts with turnover numbers of 135, 205 and 125 after 24 hours for the conversion of \emph{n}-hexane using pincer complexes (a) (with L = \ce{C2H4}, \ce{H2}) and (b) respectively.\cite{Goldman2006}  The activity was limited by degradation of the alkene metathesis catalyst as reaction resumed upon further addition of Schrock's catalyst.  A major advantage of this catalytic system is the selective formation of linear alkanes as no branched or cyclic alkanes were detected.\cite{Goldman2006}

\end{figure}

Replacement of Schrock's catalyst with a heterogeneous alkene metathesis catalyst was tested to increase the stability.  This \ce{Re2O7}/\ce{Al2O3} catalyst was more stable than Schrock's catalyst and showed a higher level of activity with 125 turnovers achieved with complex (b) (Figure \ref{PCPSchrock}) and 180 for complex (c) in 3 hours for the conversion of \emph{n}-decane.\cite{Goldman2006}  However, the activity of the phosphinite complexes was reduced with (a) achieving only 15 turnovers in 3 hours.  Although a high level of selectivity with complexes (b) and (c) for terminal alkenes has been reported for the dehydrogenation,\cite{Liu1999} the product distribution (Figure \ref{GCdistribution})  shows no preference for ethane, which would occur if this was the case.  Either isomerisation of the terminal alkene to form internal alkenes prior to metathesis, or further reaction of the alkane products must occur to account for the observed product distribution.\cite{Goldman2006, Choi2011}

\subsection{POP pincer ligands}

Although one of the first pincer ligands reported was a POP pincer,\cite{Alcock1976} this type of ligand has not been studied as extensively as the PCP and PNP analogues.  The osmium trichloride complex of \gls{dbf}(P$^i$\ce{Pr2)2} (Figure \ref{Osmiumdbf}) formed in 98\% yield when the ligand was reacted with the commercially available \ce{OsCl3}$\cdot{}$3\ce{H2O} under reflux.\cite{Asensio2010}  When the ligand is reacted with \ce{OsCl2(DMSO)4} (DMSO = dimethylsulfoxide) the \emph{trans}-dichloro \gls{DMSO} complex (Scheme \ref{Osmiumdbfscheme}) is formed.\cite{Esteruelas2011} This complex can be converted to trihydridechloride and tetrahydride osmium complexes upon reaction with hydrogen gas in the presence of triethylamine or sodium hydrid,e respectively.  The tetrahydride complex is an active catalyst for the coupling of amines and alcohols to give imines achieving a 98\% yield after 3 hours for the coupling of benzyl alcohol and aniline.  Lower yields of 49 and 54\% were obtained when the \gls{DMSO} and trihydride complexes were used.\cite{Esteruelas2011}

A theoretical study has suggested that POP pincers could be utilised as ligands for ruthenium catalysed synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen gases.\cite{Holscher2007}  The PNP and PSP ligands (Figure \ref{Theoreticalammonia}) have much higher activation barriers for the formation of the active catalytic species than the POP ligands.  Theoretical studies into Shilov chemistry have shown that the presence of an oxygen or nitrogen ligand \emph{trans} to the methane results in much lower activation barriers.\cite{Zhu2009}  The two-step process for C-H activation involves the loss of a ligand followed by coordination of the methane.  The C-H activation has no discernible energy barrier when an oxygen ligand is present in the \emph{trans}-position, however the intial loss of the ligand is much faster for ligands with a higher \emph{trans}-influence making the nitrogen donors much better overall.  Given a system where other factors promoted the loss of the ligand (such as steric bulk) it may be possible that the oxygen-donor ligands are better overall.

Research into the effect of different phosphorus substituents on the reactivity of ruthenium POP pincer complexes has been reported.\cite{Major2005}  Reaction of \ce{[RuCl2(}\emph{p}-\ce{cymene)]2} (\gls{cymene} = 1-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)benzene) with the sterically bulky POP-\ce{^{t}}Bu yielded the five-coordinate complex, [Ru\ce{Cl2}(POP)] (Scheme \ref{RutheniumPOP}).  However, the less bulky POP-\ce{^{i}Pr} formed a dimeric species.  Both species were able to form molecular hydrogen complexes however, with the POP-\ce{^{i}}Pr, the \ce{H2} occupies the site \emph{trans} to the ether whilst it occupies the site \emph{trans} to chloride with the bulkier POP-\ce{^{t}}Bu.  The difference was ascribed to the \ce{H2} occupying the most sterically restrained site in the presence of the POP-\ce{^{t}}Bu as it is the smallest ligand (based on van der Waals radii).

\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{../Schemes/RutheniumPOP.pdf}

\end{scheme}

The different reactivity was also observed in reaction of the complexes with nitrogen (Scheme \ref{RutheniumPOP}).\cite{Major2005}  The less bulky POP-\ce{^{i}}Pr formed a complex analogous to the molecular hydrogen complex and the two were readily interconverted.  However, the bulky POP-\ce{^{t}}Bu did not react spontaneously with nitrogen and required chloride abstraction using \ce{NaBPh4} in order to form the five-coordinate complex [RuCl\ce{N2}(POP)]\ce{BPh4}.

POP ligands also have the potential for hemilability of the central donor group whereby the oxygen can bind reversibly to the metal centre in order to stabilise catalytic intermediates. This has been utilised in the hydroacylation of alkenes and alkynes using a rhodium pincer complex, where the oxygen can bind in order to stabilise important intermediates and prevent the competing decarbonylation reactions from occuring.\cite{Moxham2006, Moxham2008, Pawley2010}  A range of rhodium complexes with \gls{xantphos} or \gls{DPEphos} as ancillary diphosphine ligands were tested for the hydroacylation reaction.\cite{Moxham2006}  The \gls{DPEphos} complexes were more active than the \gls{dppe} complex used for comparison, achieving conversions of 100\% after 30 min and 90 min respectively.  However, the xantphos complex was completely inactive.  The different reactivity is thought to be a result of the flexibility of the backbone.\cite{Pawley2010}  The more flexible \gls{DPEphos} readily exhibits hemilability whilst the less flexible xantphos can form either tridentate or bidentate complexes but does not readily convert between the two.\cite{Moxham2006, Pawley2010}  Utilising a PCP pincer resulted in decomposition whilst a PSP pincer bound too strongly to the metal to allow catalysis to occur.\cite{Moxham2008}

\subsection{Xantphos}
	
First reported in 1995 by Kranenburg et al.,\cite{Kranenburg1995} the diphosphine ligand \gls{xantphos} and its derivatives (Figure \ref{Xantphosligands}) were designed to investigate the influence of the bite angle on catalytic reactions, in particular rhodium catalysed hydroformylation.  The bite angle is the angle between the two phosphorus atoms on the diphosphine and the metal centre as shown in Figure \ref{Biteangle}. Utilising different backbones such as diphenyl ether or dibenzofuran, or varying the group in the xantphos backbone to S, \ce{SiMe2} or \ce{CMe2} altered the sterics of the ligand resulting in a change in the bite angle (Table \ref{Biteangletable}).\cite{Kranenburg1995}

In the hydrocyanation of styrene, ligands with bite angles close to 105\degrees~resulted in high yields and selectivities whilst decreasing the bite angle to 101\degrees or increasing to 110\degrees~led to a much lower activity.\cite{Kranenburg1995b}  The bite angle is thought to influence the reaction by stabilising preferred reaction intermediates and destabilising inactive species.   In the hydrocyanation reaction the bite angle close to 109\degrees~ destabilises square-planar Ni(II) species and stabilises the tetrahedral Ni(0) species, enhancing the reductive elimination step and resulting in a faster reaction.\cite{Kranenburg1995b}

Since the initial studies in hydroformylation and hydrocyanation, transition metal complexes of xantphos and its derivatives have been investigated for use in a range of catalytic systems including allylic alkylation,\cite{Kranenburg1998} CO/ethene copolymerisation,\cite{Freixa2003} and C-C and C-X cross-coupling reactions\cite{Birkholz2009} among others.  In addition, a range of further derivatives of xantphos have been synthesised.  Rhodium complexes of the water-soluble xantham\cite{Buhling1997} and sulfoxantphos (Figure \ref{Xantham}) have been used for biphasic hydroformylation.\cite{Goedheijt1998}

Xantphos has a range of potential binding modes (Figure \ref{Xantphosbinding}).  By far the most common is the \emph{cis}-bidentate chelating mode (a) with both phosphorus atoms bonding to the metal.  Less commonly the \emph{trans}-bidentate chelating diphosphine mode (b) is observed.  A third, tridentate binding mode (c) is also possible where the oxygen binds in addition to the two phosphorus atoms.  A recent search of the Cambridge Crystallographic Database revealed 107 X-ray crystal structures of coordination complexes with xantphos derived ligand of these only five exhibited the tridentate binding mode.  A monodentate binding mode is also possible, though it is very rare with only one crystal structure reported to date.\cite{Escalle2009}

\end{figure}

Ruthenium complexes of xantphos have been utilised for the activation of dihydrogen to form dihydride complexes (Scheme \ref{Xantphosdihydrogen}).\cite{Lenero2003}  Reaction of [Ru(cod)(cot)] (\gls{cot} = 1,3,5-cyclooctatriene) with the diphosphine in a hydrogen atmosphere led to the formation of the \emph{cis}-dihydride.  Protonation of this complex at low temperature (183 K) formed a molecular hydrogen complex that could eliminate hydrogen gas when allowed to warm to 233 K.

Xantphos and DPEphos ruthenium complexes displaying the tridentate binding mode exhibit reversible bonding of dihydrogen and dinitrogen, together with irreversible binding of peroxide (Scheme \ref{Gascomplexes}).\cite{Ledger2010}  The molecular hydrogen and nitrogen complexes form upon exposure of a dichloromethane solution of the complex to 1 atm of the appropriate gas at low temperature (180 K).  These complexes were unstable and degraded when exposed to higher temperature.  The peroxide complexes form spontaneously on exposure of a dichloromethane solution to air and are stable under ambient conditions.
