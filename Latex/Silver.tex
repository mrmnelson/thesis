\chapter{Coordination Complexes with Silver}
\chaptermark{Silver}
\label{ch:silver}

Silver has been used as a precious metal, used in coins, jewellery and other ornamentation at least since 4000\BC, coins, tableware and other utensils.  Silver halides are used in photographic film and other silver salts have a wide range of health and food applications, such as wound dressings and water storage tanks.\cite{Enghag2004Ag}  Silver coordination complexes also display biological activity.  \emph{Bis}-diphosphine silver complexes were reported to show anti-tumour and anti-fungal activity.\cite{Berners-Price1988, Liu2008}  Silver is also used industrially as a catalyst for the conversion of ethene to ethylene glycol and silver salts are occasionally used as co-catalysts in cross-coupling reactions.\cite{Suzuki1999}  Complexes of silver have gained attention recently as potential catalysts in a number of transformations including Si-H activation\cite{Iglesias2012} asymmetric aldol conversions \cite{Sawamura1990} and allylation of benzaldehyde\cite{Malaise2006, Yanagisawa1999}.

% \fixme{find the article from wikipedia to cite here}  Silver coordination complexes have also show biological activity.  \emph{Bis}-diphosphine silver complexes have shown anti-tumour and anti-fungal activity.\cite{Berners-Price1988, Liu2008}

%Silver is used industrially as a catalyst to convert ethene to ethylene glycol on an industrial scale.  It is also often used in the control rods of nuclear reactors.  Silver has also found use as a component in the Oddy test.  This test is used to determine if materials give off gases which may be harmful to art and historical artefacts, specifically the silver is used to detect reduced sulfur and sulfur carbonyl compounds.  \fixme{this needs some citations}

%Furthermore  silver complexes have gained attention recently as potential catalysts in a number of transformations including Si-H activation\cite{Iglesias2012} asymmetric aldol conversions \cite{Sawamura1990} and allylation of benzaldehyde\cite{Malaise2006, Yanagisawa1999}.

The coordination chemistry of silver is interesting due a high degree of geometrical flexibility. The bite angle, electronic influence of the diphosphine, and the coordination mode of ancillary ligands can all impact the type of complex formed.  Some of the possible structures formed for an equimolar reaction of a silver salt with a diphosphine range from the straightforward monometallic complex to multi metallic clusters with bridging diphosphines (Figure \ref{Silverstructures}).  For a good overview of silver coordination chemistry see Meijboom et al.\cite{Meijboom2009}.

%In addition to forming unusual coordination environments silver complexes have also been extensively studied due to their biological activity.  Bisdiphosphine silver complexes have shown anti-tumour and anti-fungal activity.\cite{Berners-Price1988, Liu2008} A recent study (Liu2008) showed that silver complexes of bidentate pyridyl phosphines showed in vitro anti-tumour activity.  

Silver complexes of xanthene backboned ligands have been reported previously.\cite{Malaise2006, Balakrishna2008}  In all cases the complexes are monometallic and the majority of these structures are tetrahedral complexes of the type [Ag(diphosphine)(NN)] where NN represents a bidentate nitrogen ligand such as 2,2'-bipyridine.\fixme{cite Japanese patents}.  These [Ag(diphosphine)(NN)] complexes have been patented for their luminescent properties.\fixme{cite Japanese patents}  Other tetrahedral complexes include other chelating ligands \fixme{structure with PO} or two monodentate ligands such as \fixme{refer to thiopyridine structure}.  Only one trigonal silver xantphos complex \fixme{structure AgBr} has been reported to date.\cite{Kaltzoglou2007}.  However, this is likely due to a lack of research rather than synthetic difficulties as trigonal silver complexes with a chiral xantphos derivative have also been reported.\cite{Malaise2006}

%The more flexible backbone of DPEphos allows the formation of triflate or iodide bridged dimers.\cite{Balakrishna2008}, \fixme{find the iodide reference}  Silver complexes of a chiral xantphos derivative \fixme{reference} have also been reported.  

%A trigonal silver complex [AgBr(xantphos)] was synthesised by direct reaction of silver bromide and xantphos in refluxing acetone or acetonitrile.\cite{Kaltzoglou2007}

Crystals structures of the previously mentioned \fixme{refer to structures} [AgBr(Ph-xantphos)] and [Ag(HpyS)(Ph-xantphos)] have been reported.  In the trigonal structure the P-Ag-P angle is 109.371\degrees{} which increases to 111.507\degrees{} for [Ag(HpyS)(Ph-xantphos)].  Pyridine thiol can act as a bidentate chelating ligand, however in this case monodentate coordination is observed.  The natural bite-angle for Ph-xantphos (111.7\degrees) is very close to the observed bite-angle (111.51\degrees).  In order for the pyridine thiol to chelate the P-Ag-P angle would need to decrease significantly, the rigidity and steric bulk of the Ph-xantphos prevents this from happening.\cite{Kaltzoglou2007}

%The reported complexes are all trigonal geometries with the general formula \ce{[Ag(diphosphine)X]} where X = a negatively charged ligand OTf-, BF4 for Malaise2006.  Of most relevance to this work is the complex [AgBr(xantphos)] reported by Kaltzoglou.\cite{Kaltzoglou2007}  This complex exists as a monomeric species with a P-Ag-P angle of 109.38\degrees{}, very close to the natural bite-angle for xantphos (111.7\degrees).\cite{Kranenburg1995}  The complex reacted with a heterocyclic thione forming the tetrahedral species [AgBr(xantphos)(py2SH)].  The P-Ag-P angle for this is increased slightly to 111.51\degrees{}.  The steric bulk of the xantphos ligand was proposed as the reason for the lack of chelation.\fixme{chelation SN}

%\fixme{Why don't the commas and full-stops look nice under the degrees symbol?}

Given the propensity of silver to form a wide range of different coordination geometries depending on the ligands and the number of potential applications for silver complexes, together with the tendency to coordinate xantphos close to the natural bite-angle, made silver an excellent metal to begin our investigation of the coordination chemistry of the \tBuxantphos{} ligands.  Furthermore silver consists of two spin \nicefrac{1}{2} isotopes, \Agseven{} and \Agnine{} with abundances of 51.8 and 48.2\% respectively.  This allows for further information to be obtained from the value of \JAgP{}.

\section{Silver Chloride Complexes}

Silver chloride complexes were synthesised by addition of the \tBuxantphos{} ligand to a suspension of silver chloride in deutero-chloroform (Scheme \ref{Silverchloride}), resulting in [AgCl(diphosphine)] compexes.  In all cases the mass spectrum showed a clear peak for \ce{[M-Cl]+} with no peaks observed for dimers or higher oligomers.  The \phosphorus{} NMR spectra (See Figure \ref{NMRAgCl} for an example) showed the expected pair of doublets in all cases, as summarised in Table~\ref{table:silverchlorides}.  No relationship is observed between the natural bite-angle and the values of \JAgP.  However the change in the phosphorus chemical shift ($\Delta\delta$) increases with decreasing bite-angle.  This indicates that the increase in shielding is larger the smaller the bite-angle.  As discussed in Section \ref{section:ligandsynthesis} the free \tBuxantphos{} ligands exhibit a  \ce{X18A}A'\ce{X18}' spin system owing to through-space coupling of the phosphorus atoms, which is larger for the smaller bite-angle ligand \tBusixantphos{}.  Hence the phosphorus atoms are less shielded in \tBusixantphos{} than \tButhixantphos{} which is less shielded than \tBuxantphos.  However, when the ligands coordinate to the silver atom the through-space coupling no longer exits and is instead replaced by coupling across the silver.

The \proton{} NMR spectra (representative example, [Ag(\tBusixantphos)Cl], Figure \ref{NMRAgCl}), shows the expected three aromatic signals and a singlet for the silyl methyl protons.  The \tBu{} protons appear as a second order multiplet of the \ce{X18A}A'\ce{X18}' type, similarly to the free ligand.  The \carbon{} NMR spectra (Figure \ref{NMRAgCl} bottom) display some very distinctive signals.  The \emph{ipso} phosphorus carbon on the aryl ring and the quaternary \tBu{} carbon appear as apparent quartets, while the methyl \tBu{} carbons' signal is an apparent triplet of doublets.  For each of these signals we would expect a doublet of virtual triplets or virtual triplet of doublets for each of the silver isotopologues.  Owing to this complex spin system the nature of these multiplets was unable to be determined in more detail.  

%Similar complexes to \fixme{insert reference to the xantphos one} were synthesised for the sulfur, silicon and carbon bridged tBu-xantphos ligands.  The ligands were reacted with silver chloride in the dark and generated the expected [AgCl(L)] complexes.  The \phosphorus{} NMR spectra showed the expected pair of doublets in all cases as summarised in Table~\ref{table:silverchlorides}.  All had mass spectra that showed a clear peak for [M-Cl-]+ with no sign of any dimeric species, clearly indicating a monomeric species.  

Colourless crystals of [Ag(\tButhixantphos)Cl] suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction were obtained \fixme{by inwards diffusion of \ce{Et2O} into a \ce{CH2Cl2} solution of the complex.}  The structure of \fixme{compound number} is shown in Figure \ref{Crystalthixantphossilverchloride} confirming the proposed monomeric trigonal structure.  Selected bond lengths and angles, and crystallographic data are given in Tables \ref{table:crystalthixantphossilverchloride:lengths} and\ref{table:crystalthixantphossilverchloride:data} respectively.  \fixme{compound number} crystallised in the P2\sub{1} space group, while the similar complex [Ag(Ph-xantphos)Br] crystallised in the higher symmetry P2\sub{1}/\emph{m} space group.  The bite-angle P-Ag-P of 130.50(7) is larger than the bite-angle for [Ag(Ph-xantphos)Br] (109.37(1)).  The silver oxygen distance of 3.007(6) \si{\angstrom} indicates no interaction. 

A side view of [Ag(\tButhixantphos)Cl] in Figure \ref{Crystalthixantphossilverchloride:sideview} shows the angle of the P-Ag-Cl relative to the ligand backbone.   The chloride is not centred evenly, with a difference in the P-Ag-Cl angles of 3.49\degrees.  This difference is likely the result of the backbone twisting with the chloride occupying the least sterically hindered site.  The backbone is bent resulting in two distinct faces of the molecule.  In [Ag(tBu-thixantphos)Cl] the chloride sits on the convex face of the ligand while in [Ag(Ph-xantphos)Br] (Figure \ref{AgxantphosBr}) the bromide ligand occupies the concave face.  In addition the dihedral angles C(aryl)-P-Ag-Cl of 159.8(3) and 147.4(3) are significantly different from the corresponding dihedral angle in [Ag(Ph-xantphos)Br] of 109.6(4).  This difference in the coordination plane is likely the result of the steric influence of the \tBu{} groups compared to the phenyl rings; the chloride prefers to sit below the \tBu{} groups rather than intercalating with the phenyl rings.  The backbone bending would result in two different sets of \tBu{} groups, which would have different NMR properties.  However, this is not apparent in the NMR (Figure \ref{NMRAgCl}) indicating that in solution the backbone is likely inverting on the NMR timescale.  

\fixme{should I include a figure of the inversion?}

\fixme{compare bite-angle to the nature bite-angle calculated for tBu-thixantphos}

%Silver thixantphos chloride was successfully crystallised as colourless crystals in the \fixme{P21} space group (Figure \ref{crystalthixantphossilverchloride}).  Selected bond lengths and angles, and crystallographic data are given in Tables \ref{table:crystalthixantphossilverchloride:lengths} and \ref{table:crystalthixantphossilverchloride:data} respectively.  The X-ray crystal structure shows a trigonal planar structure with the P-Ag-P angle of 130.4\degrees moderately distorted from the ideal trigonal planar structure.  The Ag-O distance is well outside the sum of the van der waals radii indicating no interaction between the two atoms.  The bite-angle is very close to the natural bite-angle calculated for tBu-thixantphos as 131.4\degrees.  As such the coordination geometry is likely driven very much by ligand effects rather than the silver or the chloride.  Silver can form a huge array of different coordination geometries and generally the preferred structure is controlled by ligand effects.\fixme{get a citation}

%In the solid state structure of silver tBu-thixantphos chloride the backbone shows a significant degree of twisting \fixme{get some info about how much twisting is present} and is bent to give two distinct halves of the molecule.  The chloride is on the convex side of the molecule rather than the \fixme{less sterically hindered - check this} concave side and is not perfectly centred with a difference in the P-Ag-Cl angles of 3.49\degrees{}.  This difference is likely due to the backbone twisting and the chloride occupying the least sterically hindered space.  This structure would result in two distinct sets of t-Bu groups, the two on the convex face and the two on the concave face.  However, this is not observed in the NMR spectra.\fixme{the NMR of the tBu is a bit of a mess and I need to look at it again}  This indicates that the backbone is not static in solution but is inverting on the NMR timescale such that the signals for the two t-Bu environments average and only a single t-Bu \proton{} resonance and two t-Bu \carbon{} resonances are observed.  

The spectroscopic data for the three [Ag(diphosphine)Cl] diphosphine = \tBuxantphos, \tButhixantphos, \tBusixantphos, complexes indicates significant similarities, with no major discrepancies between the three.  Hence it is likely that all three complexes have the similar trigonal geometries with no silver-oxygen interaction as determined by the crystal structure for [Ag(tBu-thixantphos)Cl].

\section{Reactions with Silver Tetrafluoroborate}

Complexes of the type \ce{[Ag(L)]BF4} were synthesised in order to investigate the coordination of the diphosphine ligands in the absence of other ligands.  Although tetrafluoroborate can coordinate to silver, it is unusual for it to do so, \fixme{ref} and numerous examples exist of silver complexes with free coordination sites that have a non-coordinated \ce{BF4-} counterion (Figure \ref{Linearsilver}).  In addition, if the tetrafluoroborate coordinates to the silver this will be easily determined by \fluorine{} NMR spectroscopy.  Previous reports have shown that in the presence of an ether group and a tetrafluoroborate ion a linear diphosphine complex with mutually \emph{trans} phosphorus atoms and no other ligands was synthesised.  

\begin{figure}[htbp]

The reaction between \ce{AgBF4} and the \tBuxantphos{} ligands proceeded at room temperature in \ce{CH2Cl2}, going to completion in under one hour (Scheme \ref{SilverBF4}).  The resulting complexes are light-sensitive in solution and a \ce{CDCl3} solution of the complexes shows complete degradation in 12 hours.  For all three diphosphine ligands the mass spectra showed a molecular ion peak corresponding to \ce{[Ag(diphosphine)]+}. In all cases the \phosphorus{} NMR spectra (for an example see Figure \ref{NMRAgBF4}) show the expected pair of doublets, indicating a chelation to a single silver atom.  No relationship between the bite-angle and the \JAgPseven{} or \JAgPnine{} coupling constants was observed.  The \JAgPseven{} or \JAgPnine{} coupling constants are larger than those for the silver chloride complexes (Table \ref{table:silverchlorides}).  This is consistent with their formulation as two-coordinate silver complexes as the values of M-P coupling constants for \ce{d10} metals generally increase with decreasing coordination number.  

The \fluorine{} NMR spectrum shows a single resonance between -151.3 and -151.9 ppm, indicating a non-coordinating \ce{BF4-}.  In the \proton{} NMR spectra the \tBu{} resonance appears as a virtual triplet.  Virtual triplets commonly occur for X\sub{n}AA'X'\sub{n} when A and A' are strongly coupled such that \JXX{AA'} is very much larger than the difference in \JXX{AX} and \JXX{AX'}.  In coordination compounds this condition is typically met if the two phosphorus atoms are in a \emph{trans} configuration resulting in a strong coupling of the spin system.  In this case as the triplet is not a perfect 1:2:1 triplet it is likely that the phosphines are not strictly \emph{trans} but instead a slightly bent complex is formed.  

%With the tBu-xantphos ligands a single resonance in the \fluorine{} NMR spectrum (with two signals due to the \Bten{} and \Beleven{} isotopomers) was observed in the position expected for a non-coordinating \ce{BF4-}.  However no evidence for oxygen coordination was found.  As such it is likely that similar to previous reports the structure is an electron-deficient 14-electron silver diphosphine linear complex.

Similarly to the silver chloride complexes, the \ce{[Ag(diphosphine)]BF4} complexes show distinctive peaks in their \carbon{} NMR spectra (see Figure \ref{NMRAgBF4} for a representative example).  The most downfield signal is the \emph{ipso} carbon attached to the oxygen.  This signal appears as a virtual triplet, as expected for a XAA'X' system with strongly coupled phosphorus atoms.  The signals for the \emph{ipso} carbon attached to phosphorus, and the quaternary and methyl \tBu carbons, all appear as triplets of doublets.  We would expect these signals to appear as a pair of virtual triplets of doublets, if the two left most peaks of one triplet of doublets overlapped with the two central peaks of the other triplet of doublets this could result in an apparent triplet of doublets (assuming that the virtual triplet is not a strict 1:2:1 triplet, which is likely applicable here as the \proton{} NMR signal for the \tBu{} protons was not a 1:2:1 triplet).

The \ce{[Ag(diphosphine)]BF4} complexes have two free coordination sites; however, there is no evidence for either the ligand oxygen atom or the \ce{BF4-} acting as another ligand.  This is likely due to the steric constraints of the larger bite-angle ligands and the bulky \tBu{} groups.  Attempts were made to react the analogous \ce{[Ag(diphosphine)]PF6} (diphosphine = \tBuxantphos{}, \tBusixantphos{}, \tButhixantphos{}) complexes with ethene, ethyne and carbon monoxide, however no reaction was observed.\fixme{cite Bill's 306 project}

Silver acetylide complexes have gained attention recently due to their luminescent properties.\cite{Yam1997, Yam1998, Xu2013}  Silver acetylides supported by phosphine ligands tend to form cluster complexes with no monomeric structures currently reported in the \fixme{abb. CCDC}.  Attempts to synthesise a silver acetylide complex by reaction of \ce{[Ag(\tBuxantphos)]BF4} with lithium phenylacetylide was marred by difficulties.  The reaction was carried out in freshly distilled THF under argon, in the dark.  After 12 hours the THF was removed in vacuo and the residue was extracted into a deuterated solvent and analysed by NMR spectroscopy.  In \ce{CDCl3} or \ce{d6-acetone} a significant amount of \ce{DCCPh} was observed in the \carbon{} NMR spectrum, indicating reaction between the solvent and any acetylide complex that may have formed, or no reaction had occurred and the solvent was quenching the lithium acetylide.  The \phosphorus{} NMR spectra showed a pair of doublets with different chemical shift and coupling constants to the starting material showing that a reaction had indeed occurred. 

When the reaction was repeated and extracted into \ce{C6D6} the resulting NMR spectra were broad, with a pair of multiplets present in the \phosphorus{} NMR as we would expect if a silver cluster was formed.  The \proton{} and \carbon{} NMR spectra were also broad, however no peaks for free phenyl acetylene were observed, indicating that reaction had occurred with likely coordination.  Unfortunately this complex was unstable and degraded completely in 24 hours to an insoluble black material.  This material may be a higher order cluster, oligomer or polymeric species which commonly form with silver acetylide complexes.  Further characterisation of the intermediate complex or the resulting degradation product were unsuccessful.

\section{Conclusions}

%14-electron silver complexes are relatively unusual due to the ability of silver to form a large number of different coordination geometries including a large number of possible dimers.  We do not see any evidence of a dimer, trimer or higher order oligiomer in the mass spectrum \fixme{would this have the same m/z though?} or in the \phosphorus{} NMR spectrum as we may expect to see additional silver coupling.  As such a monomeric 14-electron diphosphine complex is proposed as the product of the reaction between \ce{AgBF4} and the tBu-xantphos ligands.
