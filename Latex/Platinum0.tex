\chaptermark{Palladium(0) and Platinum(0)}
\label{ch:platinum0}

Palladium and platinum are two rare elements of the so-called platinum group metals.  Although both palladium and platinum are rare elements palladium is around three times more common than platinum with an abundance in the earth's crust of 0.015 and 0.005 for palladium and platinum respectively.  Both palladium and platinum find uses in their elemental form in jewellery, most commonly as alloys with gold.  Palladium and platinum both find use as heterogeneous catalysts.  Large amounts of both metals are used in catalytic converters to oxidise the unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide that can be produced \emph{via} incomplete combustion.  Platinum also finds use as a metal in the electronics industry and as platinum crucibles.  Both of these applications rely on the high chemical and thermal resistance of platinum, particularly in the case of platinum crucibles which are frequently used to dissolve mineral samples using aggressive reagents such as hydrofluoric acid.  Indeed metallic platinum is so inert that an alloy of 90\%{} platinum and 10\%{} iridium (w/w) is used as the material for the international prototype kilogram, the mass of which defines the kilogram unit.  

Coordination complexes of palladium and platinum are used extensively.  The most well-known platinum complex is \ce{[Pt(NH3)2Cl2]} (cisplatin).  Cisplatin, distributed under the trade name platinol is a widely used chemotherapeutic which is used in conjunction with other therapies for the treatment of various cancers, most commonly tumours including sarcomas, carcinomas and lymphomas.  A further two platinum complexes (carbonplatin and oxaliplatin) have been approved for use in chemotherapy worldwide with other complexes approved in select countries.\cite{Wilson2013}

Palladium complexes are some of the most commonly used coordination complexes in homogeneous catalysis, finding use in a wide-range of reactions including cross-coupling, allylic alkylation and various carbonylation reactions among many others, typically forming C-C, C-N and C-O bonds.  These transformations are highly important for industrial processes and laboratory scale total-synthesis.  These catalytic reactions generally involve palladium in the 0 and +2 oxidation states.  Palladium is commonly used due to its balance of reactivity and stability, which is important for catalysts to have a high turnover frequencies and numbers.  This high reactivity can make the complexes and catalytic process difficult to study, hence platinum coordination complexes are frequently used as models for the palladium systems.  Platinum as previously discussed is inert to various processes such as oxidation and platinum also forms stronger coordination bonds thus resulting in a decreased likelihood of ligand dissociation.  Furthermore 34\% of natural platinum is the spin active isotope, \Pt{}, with a spin of -\nicefrac{1}{2}.  This results in the potential for platinum satellites to be observed in the NMR spectra of platinum coordination complexes, the coupling constant from this can result in further information about the complexes, and assist in characterisation.  However, platinum and palladium are otherwise very similar metals which makes the additional insight gained from platinum models of value when examining similar chemistry with palladium.  


%Palladium is one of the most commonly used metals for homogeneous catalysis, finding use in a wide-range of reactions including cross-coupling, homo-coupling, allylic alkylation.  \fixme{references and other examples}.  Platinum is a useful model for palladium as (being in the same group) the coordination chemistry is similar, while the 25\% abundance of the spin \nicefrac{1}{2} isotope \Pt{} results in platinum satellites the coupling constants of which can give useful information about the structure of the complex.  

Previous work with wide bite-angle ligands based on xanthene backbones has encountered difficulties when attempting coordination to Pt and Pd(II).  The reactions proceed giving either a mixture of products\cite{Malaise2006, Veen200s0b} or dynamic processes \cite{Veen2000b}.  The square planar geometries preferred by these metals allows for either \emph{cis} or \emph{trans} coordination allowing for bite-angles of 90 or 180\degrees{}.  The xanthene based ligands have bite-angles of generally around 120\degrees{} and limited flexibility.  Hence often both \emph{cis} and \emph{trans} complexes form or an interconversion between the two is observed.  As such more work has been carried out with metals that are less rigid in their coordination geometries, such as Rh.  

Platinum xantphos complexes have shown particular activity in the allylation of amines.\cite{Mora2008}

\section{Reactions with Platinum(0) Precursors}
A number of different platinum(0) precursors have been utilised in this work.  Due to the lack of characterised platinum(0) complexes of the widely used xantphos ligands a reaction between thixantphos and \emph{tris}-norborneneplatinum was carried out.  When an equimolar ratio of the ligand and the metal precusor were combined a mixture of products were formed, together with remaining \emph{tris}-norborneneplatinum (Scheme \ref{thixantphos+Pt(nb)3}).  This led to the proposal that one of the complexes was \emph{bis}-thixantphosplatinum.  The reaction was repeated with two equivalents of ligand and this complex was formed exclusively, allowing for full characterisation.  The remaining complex was formulated as thixantphos platinum norbornene.

\end{center}
\end{scheme}

\emph{bis}-Thixantphosplatinum shows an unusual pattern in the \phosphorus{} NMR spectrum.  At room temperature a single broad signal is present.  When cooled this resolves into two triplets.  This indicates that there are two different phosphorus environments in the molecule that couple to each other, however in solution at room temperature the sufficient energy is present to allow interconversion. \fixme{add some values for coupling constants etc}.

Single yellow crystals of \fixme{bis-thixantphosplatinum} suitable for X-ray crystallography were grown by inwards diffusion of diethyl into a dichloromethane solution of \fixme{bis-thixantphosplatinum} in the air.  \fixme{some stuff about similar structures}  The complex crystallised as \ce{[Pt(thixantphos)2]}$\cdot$2.5 \ce{CH2Cl2} with 2$\nicefrac{1}{2}$ molecules of dichloromethane as solvate.  The X-ray crystal structure (Figure \ref{Crystal:bisthixantphosplatinum}) is in the monoclinic space group C2/c.  Selected bond lengths and angles are given in Table \ref{table:crystalbisthixantphosplatinum:lengths} and crystallographic data is given in Table \ref{table:crystalbisthixantphosplatinum:data}. 

The platinum shows a distorted tetrahedral environment with angles ranging from 103.73 to 119.321\degrees.  There are two different phosphorus environments present in the crystal structure, such that each ligand has each of the two environments.  One phosphine on each ligand is nearer to the adjacent ligand backbone whilst the other phosphine is nearer to the adjacent phenyl substituents.  The backbone is bent away from planarity to allow the ligand to coordinate with bite angles of 106.37 and 108.06\degrees. These angles are relatively close to the natural bite angle calculated for this ligand of 109.4\degrees and well within the calculated flexibility range of 94 - 130\degrees.  At room temperature the molecule will have sufficient energy to invert the backbone which would result in the phosphorus environments switching.  Hence in the \phosphorus{} NMR spectrum we only see the average of the two environments.

When the reaction between \emph{tris}-norbornene platinum was carried out with the tertiary butyl substituted thixantphos a different result was observed.  Similarly to the reaction with the phenyl derivative an initial mixture of products was obtained.  In this case both are 1:1 complexes tBu-thixantphos:platinum.  Like the phenyl derivative one of the products is platinum thixantphos norbornene.  The other product is the two-coordinate 14-electron complex platinum thixantphos (Scheme \ref{scheme:StBuPtnb}).  \fixme{give references to these things}  

%The platinum norbornene complex exists only in the presence of excess norbornene and can readily be converted to the 14-electron complex by removing the norbornene \emph{in vacuo}.

%\fixme{Why is there a random black spot between my scheme and my caption?}

The initially formed norbornene complex \fixme{reference} exhibits a broad resonance at 55.63 ppm in the \phosphorus{} NMR spectrum with platinum satellites of 3612 Hz.  This value is typical for tridentate platinum alkene complexes. As this complex exists in an equilibrium with the 14-electron complex and is only present with excess norbornene the norbornene NMR signals are broad and some are obscured by other peaks.  The alkene protons appear at 2.37 ppm as a broad singlet with no discernable phosphorus coupling but platinum coupling of 67.8 Hz, and a similarly broad singlet in the \carbon{} NMR spectrum at 51.91 ppm with \JPtC{} = 343.9 Hz.  Half of the expected number of norbornene NMR signals are observed indicating a symmetrical complex.  Removing the excess norbornene \fixme{in vacuo} from the reaction mixture results in the exclusive formation of the two-coordinate, 14-electron platinum tBu-thixantphos complex.\fixme{ref}

The 14-electron complex \fixme{give a reference thing here} exhibits a single peak in the \phosphorus{} NMR spectrum at 78.5 ppm with a very large platinum coupling constant of 4809.5 Hz.  This value is indicative of a two-coordinate platinum(0) complex.  Several previous examples of 14-electron platinum(0) complexes have been reported.\cite{Goel1981c, Otsuka1976}  They typically form with large sterically bulky phosphines such as P\textsuperscript{t}\ce{Bu3} or P\textsuperscript{t}\ce{Bu2Ph}.  The reported complex \fixme{give a reference} has a virtual triplet for the tertiary butyl protons which is indicative of \emph{trans} coordination \cite{Harris1964}.  For a diphosphine this structure is particularly unusual as the bite-angle needs to be sufficiently large and the phosphines sufficiently bulky to prevent the coordination of solvent or other small molecules.  

Ligand \fixme{ref} tBu-Thixantphos was reacted with platinum \emph{tris}-ethene In order to investigate the role of sterics on the position of the equilibrium between the norbornene complex and the 14-electron complex.  The ligand was added to freshly synthesised \emph{tris}-ethene platinum and reacted under an ethene atmosphere.  A single product was observed in the \phosphorus{} NMR spectrum at 55.7 ppm (\JPtP{} = 3899.1 Hz) which was identified as a tBu-thixantphos platinum ethene complex (Scheme \ref{scheme:StBuPtethene}).  A single signal for the ethene was observed in the \proton{} and \carbon{} NMR spectra at 2.50 ppm (\JPtH{} = 59.5 Hz) and 34.2 ppm (\JPtC{} = 223.2 Hz).  This indicates that either the ethene is freely rotating in solution or the backbone of the ligand is inverting resulting in averaged identical averaged proton environments.

A reaction between \emph{bis}-1,5-cyclooctadiene platinum and tBu-thixantphos resulted in exclusively the 14-electron complex.  However, upon completion of the reaction peaks were observed in the \proton{} and \carbon{} NMR spectra corresponding to 1,3- and 1,4-cyclooctadiene as well as 1,5-cyclooctadiene, this was further confirmed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis of the sample.\fixme{get relative ratios?}  An intermediate was observed with a high field triplet in the \proton{} NMR at -18.2 ppm (\JPH{} = 13.7, \JPtH = 1100).  This indicates that the cyclooctadiene was likely undergoing a C-H activation reaction followed by isomerisation of the double bonds and then reductive elimination to give the different isomers.  

The three reactions with the alkenes show markedly different results.  With norbornene an equilibrium forms between the norbornene complex and the 14-electron complex, with \emph{bis}-COD platinum only the 14-electron complex forms and with \emph{tris}-ethene platinum only the ethene complex results.  This is contrary to what is expected given that COD is the strongest binding of the three alkenes due to the chelate effect and the NMR data for the ethene and norbornene complexes indicates that the ethene is less strongly bound to the platinum than the norbornene (\JPtC{} = 223.2 and 343.9 Hz respectively).  The presence of a large excess of ethene by working under an ethene atmosphere may be sufficient to push the equilibrium towards the ethene complex, however the reaction in both cases would produce two equivalents of excess alkene so this is unlikely to make a significant difference.  

The reason for this distinct difference between the three alkenes is likely to be predominantly sterics.  The COD is the largest of the three followed by norbornene then ethene \fixme{get cone angles or a reference or something}.  The thixantphos ligand has a calculated natural bite-angle of 131\degrees and has large tertiary butyl groups resulting in a large cone angle\fixme{probably best to get some data on this}.  As such the molecule is put under strain by the addition of larger alkenes which offset the additional stability that the alkenes afford by contributing electron density to the metal centre.  As COD is the largest of the three the final complex shows none of the alkene complex whilst the ethene as the smallest is exclusively the ethene complex.  However, norbornene being of an intermediate size forms an equilibrium with both the norbornene complex and the 14-electron complex coexisting.  

 %so there is more strain present in the molecule when the norbornene is bound compared to ethene which counteracts the added stability from having a 16-electron metal centre.  This strain results in a higher energy complex with little barrier to norbornene loss and little energy different between the norbornene complex and the 14-electron complex, thus resulting in an equilibrium.  In the ethene there is very little strain induced from the ethene and the additional electron density on the platinum results in the ethene complex being much lower in energy and thus no equilibrium is present between the ethene and the 14-electron complex.  

The tBu-thixantphos platinum alkene complexes and the 14-electron tBu-thixantphos platinum all react rapidly and irreversibly with oxygen to form the dioxygen complex \fixme{reference}.  The slow diffusion of oxygen into a benzene solution of the tBu-thixantphos platinum ethene complex resulted in crystals of the dioxygen complex suitable for X-ray diffraction whilst crystallisation of a solution of the 14-electron complex under argon resulted in crystals containing a mixture of the 14-electron and the dioxygen complex.  This is either a result of co-crystallisation or due to molecules at the surface of the crystal reacting with oxygen during mounting and data collection.  The dioxygen complex crystallised in the Pbca space group as [Pt(tBu-thixantphos)\ce{O2}] $\cdot{}$ \ce{2C6D6} (Figure \ref{crystal:dioxygen}).  Selected bond lengths and angles for the pure dioxygen crystals and the dioxygen and 14-electron crystals are summarised in Tables \ref{table:crystaldioxygen:lengths} and \ref{table:crystal14electron:lengths} respectively and crystallographic data is given in Tables \ref{table:crystaldioxygen:data} and \ref{table:crystal14electron:data}.

%Crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography were obtained from a benzene solution of the 14-electron complex.  The crystals were found to contain a mixture of the 14-electron and the dioxygen complex, either co-crystallised or due to the surface of the crystal reacting with oxygen during mounting and data collection.  The data quality was poor preventing anisotropic refinement.

The bite-angle of 117.25(4)\degrees{} is much smaller than the calculated bite angle \fixme{insert a reference here} due to the backbone bending and the \emph{cis} coordination in order to accommodate the dioxygen coordinating in an $\eta$\sub{2} fashion.  The oxygen-oxygen bond length is typical for platinum dioxygen complexes \fixme{refer to the crystallographic database and maybe give examples} and shows a slight lengthening upon coordination from 1.21 \si{\angstrom} in free \ce{O2} to 1.429 \si{angstrom} in the complex.  The oxygen atoms have close interactions with some of the tertiary butyl protons with the closest being 2.100 and 2.160 \si{\angstrom}.  This is within the sum of the van der waals radii (\fixme{1.20 or 1.09 \si{\angstrom}} for hydrogen and 1.52 \si{\angstrom} for oxygen).   

Comparing the two crystals structures for the dioxygen and the \fixme{co-crystallised} 14-electron and dioxygen complex we can see that the dioxygen complex is very similar in both cases.  \fixme{are they in the same space group?}.   For the dioxygen complex the platinum is planar with four substituents coplanar.  In the 14-electron complex we observe a bent configuration of the platinum.  Two-coordinate platinum complexes typically form linear configurations \fixme{check CCD} so the bent configuration is likely a result of the backbone restricting the bite-angle.  

\fixme{compare (overlap perhaps?) the dioxygen complexes obtained from each crystal structure}

The differences between the 14-electron and the dioxygen complexes are of particular interest.  The ligands share the same sites in the disordered structure indicating that little ligand rearrangement is necessary for the dioxygen to coordinate.  The 14-electron complex has a much larger bite-angle \fixme{value?} with the platinum sitting much closer to the ether bridge.  This nicely shows how a metal centre and the presence of other ligands can influence the bite-angle of a diphosphine, these effects are not accounted for in the widely used, theoretically obtained, natural bite-angle as defined by Casey and Whiteker\cite{Casey1990} and it is notable here that we have two complexes with very similar ligand positions have bite-angles of \fixme{this and this} while the natural bite angle was calculated as \fixme{this}.

In order to investigate the activation of the oxygen that occurred upon coordination a number of reactions were carried with the dioxygen complex and other small molecules.  It is unreactive towards ethene and ethyne.  The reaction with 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane (PTA) yielded uncoordinated tBu-thixantphos and \ce{[Pt(PTA)4]} with consistent spectroscopic data to previous reports.\fixme{citation} 

A number of palladium dioxygen complexes have been reported to be reduced to palladium(0) 14-electron complexes using hydrogen, either as the pure gas or as a mixture with carbon monoxide such as in formylations and alkoxy carbonylations.\cite{Sergeev2010}  However, metal dioxygen complexes have been reported as reacting rapidly with carbon monoxide yielding a metal carbonate.\cite{Goel1983b}  This indicates that in general palladium dioxygen complexes preferentially react with hydrogen rather than carbon monoxide.  As such, we decided to investigate the reactivity of the platinum dioxygen complexes with both carbon monoxide and with hydrogen.  \fixme{I should actually react it with hydrogen at some point...}
  
The dioxygen complex \fixme{reference} reacts with carbon monoxide and forms a series of intermediates before a stable final product is observed (Scheme \ref{scheme:StBuPtO2andCO}).  The reaction was carried out with enriched \textsuperscript{13}CO and a number of intermediates were able to be identified.  The first product is the expected carbonate complex \fixme{reference?} \ce{[Pt(tBu-thixantphos)CO3]} with the carbonate appearing in the \carbon{} NMR spectrum at 167.85 ppm (t, 3.9 Hz, \JPtC{} = 64.4 Hz).  This is associated with a single environment in the \phosphorus{} NMR spectrum at 15.6 ppm with \JPtP{} = 4055.4 Hz.

Unlike previously reported carbonate complexes \ce{[Pt(tBu-thixantphos)CO3]} reacts further. 
A down-field peak is observed in the proton NMR at 17.6 ppm indicating the presence of an acidic proton.  There are also two phosphorus peaks at 50.5 ppm and -38.7 ppm with satellites of 1893 and 2854 respectively.  The upfield shift of one phosphorus is commonly associated with metallation of a tertiary butyl group.\cite{Garrou1981}  Based on this data intemediate \fixme{reference} is proposed. 

Intermediate \fixme{give a reference} then loses carbon dioxide (enriched when using \carbon{}O) to give the final product \fixme{reference}.  The final product is asymmetric and retains the metallacycle from the \fixme{reference} previous compound.  The two phosphines appear at 38.2 (\JPtP{} = 1794 Hz) and -49.6 ppm (\JPtP{} = 3943 Hz).  The small coupling constant for the non-metallated carbon indicates that it is trans to a ligand with a strong trans influence, in this case the metalled t-butyl group.  The metalled phosphorus shows the significant downfield shift expected for metallation.  The identity of the final ligand has not been conclusively identified.  The large coupling constant for the metallated carbon suggests a ligand with a weak trans influence such as a halide or an oxygen donor.  The mass spec gives a signal for [M-L]\textsuperscript{+} so is of little assistance.  A hydroxyl ligand is the likely by-product from the loss of \ce{CO2} from fix me{reference}, and we would expect that a hydroxyl may well exchange with deuterium and be broad in the \proton{} NMR thus explaining the absence of the signal.  

The final two structures are particularly note-worthy due to the cis-coordination of the phosphines.  Such sterically bulky ligands show a distinct preference for trans-coordination (as we will see in \fixme{reference to platinum(II) stuff}).  The metallacyclobutane must be cis, however the ligand could still maintain a trans coordination.  It is likely that the coordination plane is distorted and the phosphines are not perfectly 90 \degrees{} thus allowing for pseudo-cis coordination.  In addition the metallation of the t-butyl may hold that part of the molecule in a particular geometry resulting in less steric hindrance for the other phosphine.

\section{Reactions with Palladium(0) Precursors}

Attempts to synthesise palladium(0) complexes were much less successful than the work with platinum(0).  Reaction between \ce{Pd2dba3} and tBu-thixantphos resulted in a single complex which showed similarities to the platinum xantphos dioxygen complexes that formed from the 14-electron complex.  A single product at 40.0 ppm in the \phosphorus{} NMR spectrum was observed and did not appear to have any associated dba.  However, the was unable to be separated from the uncoordinated dibenzylideneactone by-product. \fixme{my Pt(O2) complex is insoluble in benzene and dba probably is soluble so maybe washing with some toluene might be enough? Or crystallisation from toluene}

Cyclopentadiene palladium allyl is often used as a palladium(0) precursor in catalytic reactions as the reductive elimination of the cyclopentadiene and the allyl generates a palladium(0) and an inert \fixme{C8H8?} alkyl which is generally unreactive towards the catalyst.  Reaction between cyclopentadiene palladium allyl and tBu-thixantphos was attempted with little success.  A number of products were observed with peaks appearing at 33.5, 42.9 and 51.9 ppm in the \phosphorus{} NMR spectrum in addition to the dioxygen complex which forms over times at 40.0 ppm.  The major product is the broad signal at 42.9 ppm which may be an allyl complex or something?

The \carbon{} NMR spectrum showed signals at 147.2 and 145.1 ppm which have previously been seen with this ligand for the proton adjacent to the phosphine selenide.  This significant shift is a result of close proximity to a heavy atom so it may be that a very unusual coordination has formed including perhaps dimers or oligomers?  It is also possible that there may be an allyl or something strange forming \fixme{check for free cp} perhaps some sort of propene structure?

An alternative route to palladium(0) could include the reaction with \emph{tris}norbornene palladium which would be an exact analogue of the successful reaction with \emph{tris}norbornene platinum.  Another attempt could be via the reduction of the relatively easy to synthesise dichloropalladium tBu-xantphos complexes.  However reduction of palladium dichlorides requires a cis-coordination of the chlorides if this is not the case then the chlorides are often substituted for hydride ligands.\fixme{try this and see what happens with [Pd(tBu-thixantphos)Cl]}.  In this case however, due to the lability of palladium and one of the chloride ligands it may be that it can reorganise to a pseudo-cis configuration for the reduction or I may form a dihydride.  It is also possible that this is atmosphere dependent and that doing the reaction in the air may result in the Pd(0) dioxygen complex.
